Teaching during the PhD can be accomplished through different ways. It is possible to do the classic in-class teaching of course or laboratory course, but also it is possible to teach through supervision. During my PhD, I have:
- Taught in workshops locally and internationally
- Supervised several international bachelor students

- Reviewed grant applications by PhD students/Postdocs at the WCMM research school. 
- Trained several people of different academic levels on the use of different technologies.
