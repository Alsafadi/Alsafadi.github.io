section: "09. ETHICAL ISSUES"
---

Since we deal with patient material and animals in our projects, several ethical issues have to be considered to avoid any harm to anyone. While different projects have different levels of ethical discussion, I do believe that all projects without exception must have some ethical issues to discuss.

We continuously discuss ethical issues in my group and address all issues at they appear.
