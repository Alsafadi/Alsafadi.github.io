Maximillian Ottosson is the CEO of Cellevate. He started this company in 2014 and now in 2021 the company has collaborators and customers around the globe. 

I sat down with Max to ask him questions about the struggles and challenges that he faced during his endeavor. At this stage in my PhD, I am contemplating which direction I want to take after my PhD and whether I should be planning this early on.

The conversation was very inspiring and had a lot eye openers. While, I have not decided yet which route to take after the PhD, I can certainly say I have learned a lot from this conversation.
