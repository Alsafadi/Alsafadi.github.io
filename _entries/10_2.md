During the keystone conference I joined a career development sessions and talked to several well-established scientists. I found this session very interesting and made me reflect on my career.

This workshop will included **6 influential scientific leaders**:

* Juanita Merchant, University of Arizona College of Medicine
* Valentina Greco, Yale School of Medicine
* Deborah Johnson, CEO, Keystone Symposia
* Arjun Rah, University of Pennsylvania
* Frederic de Sauvage, Genentech
* Thale Jarvis, CSO, Keystone Symposia

_The workshop aimed to expose students and post docs to the breadth of scientific opportunities that are available to them, encourage trainees to discuss career options with scientific leaders, and develop mentorship relationships outside of their own laboratories._
