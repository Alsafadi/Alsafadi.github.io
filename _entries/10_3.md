I have applied for one of the fysiografen calls during 2020 in order to co-finance the Cytation 5 device. I asked for nearly 450 000 SEK. I gave it my best and I think I did ok. But unfortunately, I was not selected to receive any funding from this grant call. 

Of course, there are many questions I have on why. This lead me to reflect on many things like:

- Was this grant the right type of grant?

- Was I qualified to apply for such a grant?

- Was the requested amount too high for this call?

- Should I try again with a different call?

There isn't a one way to answer all of these questions. There are several ways to address these issues. 

We found out that there was a priority for PhD students who have finished their half time on this grant call. So it is possible that this has contributed to the fact that I did not get the grant. 

In any case, I think I learned a lot from writing this one, and I will not stop there. I will keep improving and keep applying.
