My supervisor, Dr. Darcy Wagner, has applied for a collaborative grant with Cellevate and Region Sk√•ne to fight COVID-19.

The application got to the interview and I was given the opportunity to join this interview to discuss work on the isolation of human bronchial epithelial cell. 

This was a large grant (5 million SEK) and it is the first time I sit in such interview. It was a great experience for me.

It was such a great feeling to learn that the grant was awarded.

This experience has added to my career development as a scientist of how to conduct grant interviews. 


**Update:** My group leader has received this grant.
