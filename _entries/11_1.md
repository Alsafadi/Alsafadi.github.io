I have been working in the research field since 2015 which is not a long time, but fairly long enough to learn about my learning abilities. I have realized that I am very particular about how I learn things, and more importantly how I like to be supervised. I consider myself very independent and I always like to try to solve issues on my own before pursing the answer from some one else. 

I am lucky to have a unique relationship with my supervisor. We do discuss the supervision styles quite often, not only how she supervises me, but also how I can supervise others. It is a chain after all. 

LBR lab, an example, consists of more than 15 members, each of which has a unique way of learning. It is important to always observe how people perceive information and absorb new content.
