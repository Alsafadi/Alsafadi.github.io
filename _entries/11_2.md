I started the PhD program knowing that I will have to reflect on supervision as the project progresses.

We were quickly able to identify that we needed a supervisor with strong biochemistry expertise in order to address the transcription factor identification part of the project. 
My main supervisor, Darcy Wagner, has met Dr. Cant첫 in one of the WCMM retreats. I contacted him and scheduled a skype meeting. I described my project to Dr. Cant첫 and we immediately agreed that he can be very instrumental in my PhD studies. 

A few months later, we planned a pilot study and that was a confirmation for both of us that he would not only be a collaborator, but also a supervisor.

I am glad to have found Dr. Cant첫 and I look forward to the rest of my PhD.
