I was fortunate to be in the LBR lab before starting the PhD. I was able to understand the capabilities and limitations of myself and my environment. My PhD project was designed by myself and my supervisor. We worked together on finding the best experiment designs to address all questions raised under the unified aim of the study. 

The process of study design was done in tandem with writing a VR starting grant. Darcy wrote her starting grant on this project. We sat through several meetings and brain-storming to reach the final design of the project. I helped Darcy with the VR grant mainly in experiment design and figures. This experience was very useful for me to think at a higher level of project design and also to learn more skills in grant writing and creation. 

I am thankful to have had that opportunity to take a project from its very beginnings and I hope to see it through to a good place by the end of my PhD.
