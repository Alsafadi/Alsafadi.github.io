**The aftermath** I felt very good during the presentation and managed to comfortably explain all the different aspects of my PhD studies. ([**list of planned papers at the time**](/assets/files/halftime_papers.pdf)). I was able to have a good conversation with my opponents that was focused on the bigger picture an the relevance of my project, rather than experimental details of the different experiments. To me, this indicates that the quality of the experiments was high.

I hope that I will be able to complete my PhD despite the spread of the corona virus. While Sweden is not shutting down completely like other countries, we are already seeing changes in the dynamics of the different facilities and labs at the university.
