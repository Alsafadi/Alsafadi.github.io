I like drawing, sketching, and graphic design. I do it when I can as a hobby in my free time. 
But when I heard we needed a logo for our lab. I decided to give it a shot and design one. 

This is the result after getting feedback from everyone. I am glad that it is being used as the LBR logo for everything we do.

I also enjoy web design, so I managed to build the [lbr website](https://lbr-lab.com/).
