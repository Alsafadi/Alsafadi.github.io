**WCMM research school first retreat 2018 - 2019**

The VCM research school has come to an end. it has been a good year full of events, lectures, and collaborations. now it's time to close this chapter in a good way. as a student representative one of my duties was to organize the retreat for the research school.  
This was a challenging task because this was the first of its type. There are no kind of expectation for this event, and we want it to be a good event, full of good science and good fun for everybody. I think we managed to pull it off very well. We have managed to bring speakers from abroad that gave amazing talks, such as Dr Vasilis Ntziachristos’s talk on photoacoustic live imaging.  
The challenge of this experience has improved my leadership skills. Everyone who came to the retreat liked it a lot and enjoyed it very much. So that was very rewarding. I think if I have to do this again, I would do a much better job.
