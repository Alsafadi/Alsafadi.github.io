The Cytation 5 is finally here. [The cytation 5 is a high content imaging system equibed with fluorescent imaging and plate reading.](https://www.biotek.com/products/imaging-microscopy-cell-imaging-multi-mode-readers/cytation-5-cell-imaging-multi-mode-reader/)

I have gone through the process of procurement of this awesome device and so happy it is finally here. The company reps: Helene Stanberg and Fabian Kuck have been super helpful in this process.

Let the greatness begin !!!
