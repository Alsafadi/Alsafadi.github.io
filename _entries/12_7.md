At the last year of my PhD, I decided to join the doctoral student council (MDR) to represent the PhD students in one of the faculty boards. 

I nominated myself for the academic appointment board - Lärarförslagsnämnd (LFN) and MDR selected me for that role. I selected this board, because I needed to learn more about the process the university does to hire new academic roles.

One requirement for this role was that the representative has to speak Swedish. My Swedish language skills have definitely improved throughout the last four years, but I did not think it was good enough to take part in official meetings. I think I understand Swedish very well, however, it remains difficult for me to articulate what I would like to say in Swedish. Thus, I have talked to the chairs of the board and they agreed to let me speak English when I need to give a comment on a specific topic. However, the meetings were to be held in Swedish. 

I found this experience fulfilling and I think I have learned a lot from being on the LFN board. I think it may even contributed to improving my Swedish.
