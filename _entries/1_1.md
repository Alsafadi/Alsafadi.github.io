As you walk in the hallways of BMC, it is amazing how many internationals you see from all cultures and places. It is inspiring to see everyone working so well together. 

Unfortunately, few struggles and obstacles come with being international: The migration issues!!!

I have been lucky to be able to join the lab as a visiting student before transition and becoming a PhD student. While I was on a scholarship, I was on a visiting residence permit, but I had to change that to a student residence permit when my PhD studies started. 

The process has been quite challenging as I was asked to leave the country for this switch. Now, I was lucky to still have a permit to go to Germany, but if I did not, I cannot begin to think what I could do. I am from Gaza, Palestine and going back there is not possible at the time. 

Luckily, things worked out and I started my position. However, I think the HR department at the University should reflect on how much preparation they need when they hire an international verses hiring a local. There could have been a lot of things improved in that regard.
