We have faced several challenges in the building of a new lab when we moved to Sweden, but it feels great to have gotten this far. Our older location at BMC C12 was not sufficient to house all our needs for experimental space and equipment. Luckily, we have found a new location at BMC B10. Now that we are moving, it feels like a fresh beginning. 

This time we have more space and we already have most of what we need. It is very interesting to have to participate in the thought process of where things should go. Every piece is placed where it is for a reason, so it can be utilized for the best.

This is a unique learning opportunity as most PhD students do not get to contribute to the environment they perform their research.
