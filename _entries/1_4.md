It is a privilege to have the opportunity to apply for grants to join international conferences. I think this experience is very important for pursuing the research process. Later in my career, I will be applying a lot more for grants.

I have been accepted to present a poster at the Keystone Conference on Signaling dynamics and Cellular plasticity  in Keystone, Colorado, USA. This conference is great for me as it is multidisciplinary and there is a lot to learn from all the fields and to apply in my field. 

I applied for the Fysiografen grant and I was awaded 16 000 SEK  to cover some of the conference costs.

To complete the process of handling grants, I have submitted a grant report that describes my activities. [**Download Here!**](/assets/files/Grant_Report.pdf)

I have applied to the fysiografen research grants twice after: Once rejected and later another accepted. See reflection in this section. <a href="#s10" onclick="navigate('#s10')"> **See also reflection on the rejection in the Career Developement Section.**</a>
