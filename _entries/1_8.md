I just received an email with the approval letter for my most recent application to use the SNIC local storage cluster. 

This is my 6th application to be approved in association with LUNARC computation cluster.

This resource, especially, has been very instrumental throughout my PhD and is very important for anyone doing computation. We are lucky to have access to such resources at no extra cost. The only thing we need to do, is apply. 

The application process for this is very comprehensive as it requires you to explain how the computation cluster is needed for your specific project. More importantly, you apply as the PI which is of course more responsibility, but a great learning opportunity.

Examples of application and report submitted after completion of project:
