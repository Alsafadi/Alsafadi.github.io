Oxana Klementieva is a PI on our floor in BMC B10.

Oxana does a lot of advanced imaging at the different synchrotrons here in Lund, at MAXIV or our in other countries. She has her samples mounted on these special glass circular sample holders that are so sensitive. She told me about how difficult it is to transfer these samples all the time. We discussed the issue and found a solution that we could 3D- print. I designed a sample holder for these samples, and it seems to have fixed the issue. It is refreshing to fix daily issues with out-of-the-box solutions.
