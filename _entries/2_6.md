I needed to perform several experiments where a magnetic rack is needed. I did not like the fact that all available magnetic racks require you to either place all your sample on or off the rack without the option of keeping some samples on and some off temporarily. Therefore, I decided to design my own rack that does exactly what I needed to do, and the cost of 3D printing and magnets would not amount to 10th of the cost of a commercial rack. 

I have printed this rack and have used it for more than two years.
