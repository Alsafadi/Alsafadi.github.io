Dr. Sandra Linstedt is one of the thoracic surgeons at the hospital who performs lung transplantations on a regular basis. Dr. Linstedt is our WCMM partner and she is one of my PhD Co-supervisors. I have had many great discussion with her about the procedure of lung transplantation and about the tissues we obtain from the donors and patients. Dr. Linstedt will be a great source of information for me during my PhD studies.
