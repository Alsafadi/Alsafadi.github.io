I have had some experience previously with primary cell isolation from mouse and human. However, there was a substantial need to learn more to achieve proper isolation from the various types of lung epithelial tissues.


_Dr. Oskar Hallgren - HBEC isolation_
Dr. Hallgren is a senior scientist who has joined our WCMM partner Dr. Sandra Lindstedt. Dr. Hallgren has been very instrumental in helping us set up the isolation protocols for the human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs). Dr. Hallgren has been working in this field for a long time and it is a privilege to have someone to seek their advice.

For primary mouse cell isolation. I needed to improve the current technology in order to be able to isolate primary proximal and distal lung epithelial cells from the same individual mouse. I managed to make a methodological advance using 3D-printing and generated a surgical guide that aids this technique. This has become one of my first author manuscripts and is currently under review.
