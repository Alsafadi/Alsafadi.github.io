After having taken a few courses in bioinformatics analysis. I have been learning how to analysis single cell datasets on my own. There is a lot of information in published dataset that can be obtained by performing few analyses. 

Dr. Leigh is the newest WCMM fellow who joined Lund University recently to start his own lab. Dr. Leigh explores mechanisms of limb regeneration in the Axolotl. I met Dr. Leigh the first time at the Keystone conference in 2019 when he was a PostDoc in Harvard. It is great to have him around. 

Dr. Leigh has been helping me a lot in navigating single cell datasets and also bulk RNAseq datasets. Having fresh eyes from a different field is very helpful.

Moreover, Dr. Leigh helped me get started with Deconvolution of bulk RNAseq using reference single cell RNAseq datasets.
