Dr. Soneji is PI at the Stem cell center. His team is developing a new tool that allows for interpretation of scRNAseq data analysis using virtual reality. I tried it today, and it is super cool. I think this technology will be very useful for all scientists. 

Dr. Soneji has also been very helpful to me while I have been learning how to use the high powered computing cluster. I have had great conversations with him about optimization of my code to run on the cluster.
