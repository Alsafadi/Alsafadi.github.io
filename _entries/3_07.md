Dr. Cantù is a Wallenberg Molecular Medicine Fellow at Linköping University. Dr. Cantù is a developmental biologist who specializes in understanding how gene regulatory mechanisms control cell fate and organ formation during embryogenesis. 

He is an expert on pull-down mass spectrometry proteomics and ChIP sequencing. 

Dr. Cantù has agreed to be a co-supervisor for my studies. I am excited for the things I will learn in his lab.
