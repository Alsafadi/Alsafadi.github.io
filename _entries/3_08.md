Mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics is needed for my project in order to analyze the proteins that are pulled down with Yap/Taz to validate the finding from CUT&RUN.

I have started to learn the technique early on during my PhD and have done a trial run with _Dr. Neserin Ali_ in 2019 to learn the technique. 

While it is an exciting technique, I think it is more beneficial to me to acquire MS data through collaboration rather than try to the analysis myself. I think I have done enough to be able to understand the technique and the data that comes out of it. However, it will not be a technique that I want to go in depth with in the future. Thus, the best approach is to do it through collaborations.
