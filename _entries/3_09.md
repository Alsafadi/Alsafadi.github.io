I have been very fortunate to be exposed to several microscopy techniques during my PhD.

Imaging of 3D models is very important and we wanted to attempt at visualizing the mouse lung in 3D by imaging with fluorescence. Thus, we developed the necessary protocols to do it with light-sheet fluorescence microscopy that allows for larger sample size without destroying the sample with the lasers.
