NBIS has been a great source of training for me where I have learned a lot about bioinformatics analysis. I think I have developed my skills a lot with the courses I have taken there:

**SciLife Labs and NBIS: Omics Integration and Systems Biology**

SciLifeLab/NBIS, Stockholm, Sweden

**RaukR 2018. Advanced R programming for Bioinformatics Summer School**

SciLifeLab/NBIS, Visby, GÃ¶tland, Sweden
