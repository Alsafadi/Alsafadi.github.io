Lightsheet microscopy produces amazing large 3D images. While the amount of data is huge, it presents a challenge for data analysis. Attempting to analyze large 3D images using a normal screen in 2D has proved to be difficult.

We have looked into virtual reality to analysis 3D images. Luckily, a software has been developed by researchers to do this exact job: SyGlass. I have heard about this software through Dr. Shamit Soneji and I got in contact with the CEO of the company Michael Morehead.

Michael has been super helpful and has guided us through this technology very well. We do have the software license now and we are analyzing our data using it. Hopefully, we will be able to publish these analyses in the near future.
