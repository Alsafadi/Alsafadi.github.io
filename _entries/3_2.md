Dr. Richard Ingemansson is the head of thoracic surgery department and one of the surgeons performing the lung transplantation. 

I had the opportunity to show Dr. Ingemansson our work with the Precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) and how we utilize the use of lung tissue in our experimentation. Dr. Ingemansson has been a great influence on our work at LBR and his knowledge and experience in lung transplantation is of great importance to us.
