Dr. Hallgren is a senior scientist who has joined our WCMM partner Dr. Sandra Lindstedt. Dr. Hallgren has been very instrumental in helping us set up the isolation protocols for the human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs). Dr. Hallgren has been working in this field for a long time and it is a privilege to have someone to seek their advice.
