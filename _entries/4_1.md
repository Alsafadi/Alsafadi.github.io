While most journals have different guidelines for their paper submission, the process of putting a manuscript together is fairly similar all accross.

The bioRxivs has offered the ability to share the manuscript before it has been reviewed. This gives a great advantage for researchers to get feedback from the wider scientific community and also claim credit for their work. 

The lack of peer review is of course a concern with regards to the quality of the work posted. However, the fact that there isn't peer-review encourages all the readers to be more critical while reading these papers.

We have submitted my manuscript on dual cell isolation to the journal Stem Cell Reports. In the meanwhile, we also decided to submit to bioRxivs so we share this protcol with the community in order to get feedback on it.

The submission process was simple and straight forward. It is not very similar to the process of submitting to the various journals; it is a simplified version of the submission process.
