Publishing a review paper is very different from publishing primary research articles. While in a primary article you perform a mini-review in the introduction, writing a full review paper requires a lot more work in order to capture all the necessary information. When the field is growing, it is very important to make sure that you do not miss out on any publications that are related to the review question. 

This process was very demanding and required a high level of organization to keep track of all references. 

Moreover, an interesting procedure is the fact that you have to sometimes apply for permission to use your own figures that have been previously published in some journals. This is of course unfortunate, and I think journals should pay attention to the authors' rights to improve publishing conditions.
