While this paper will not be included in my thesis. It has been one of these collaborations that took a huge effort from all authors to get it accepted in Nature.

It is really interesting the amount of work needed to get a paper into these high impact factor journals. I honestly think that it is highly unreasonable. Unfortunately, publishing in high IF journals gives authors advantages when it comes to grant applications or recruitment. I do not think the science will be any less of quality if it was published in lower impact journals. I think what matters at the end is how often the article will be used by others regardless of its IF.
