It is amazing how technology has improved many aspects of data analysis and how we do research. Bioinformatics is very complex and can be used in so many ways to create complex mathamatics on the data and create complex graphics that present this data one way or another. 

**BUT ...**  The rise of bioinformatics comes with issues and challenges that the different scientific societies need to adapt to. 

One aspect that I would like to reflect on here is _reproducibility_. An improving aspect of bioinformatics that may not always be properly checked.

Sharing the code of which you have written to produce the data graphs you publish is becoming more and more common, and even a requirement in most journals. Which is GREAT!!! However, are the codes that are shared really reviewed?

Part of my PhD studies consisted of implementing several bioinformatics workflows that required me to establish snippets of code that has previosuly been published. And to my disappointment, only a small percentage of published code, can be easily reporducible. Which is SAD. 

**Why does this happen?**

One problem is the limitations imposed by the journals on the number of charecters, words, or materials associated with the paper. It is usally very difficult to summarize all the bioinformatics that you have performed in a few words. In fact, most of the codes I have written (with minimal annotation) ends up being in the hundreds of lines of code. Sometimes, a single figure can take 1 line and some other times 120 lines. Of course, this issue is easily being addressed by referencing a link to the data repository/code on github an example that has no limits like the journal limits. However, this has few issues:

- Most journals do not have the capacity<> to review code. They probably do not even look it. This is something that will need to be fixed in the future, as responsible research requires sharing enough information for reproducibility. 

- Code in repos can be changed after a paper has been published. Github, an example, keeps tracks of all the changes that occur. But not everyone is able to work with github to understand which part has been modified. Moreover, these repos can be taken down and there no way to control that. One solution to this issue is to publish code releases and share them with articles instead of links to the repos. This way the version of the code is the same as when an article is published, even if there is a newer version of the code. But, as you can already expect, most people do not do that either.


But I am happy that the tools to do this properly exist, even if they are not implemented. It is possible and recommended to be on the good side of this. 

There is a tool called Zenodo, which is almost like a journal of open source code. You post a specific release of your code and you get a DOI.. Yes, you get a DOI.. which is then citable in your paper. While this is relative new, and still needs a lot of work. I think it is going in a great direction. 

I try my best to always annotate my code properly and get it publicly released properly. Here are some examples of my code contribution:

1. Deconvolution code for AJP lung paper: [Github Repo](https://github.com/Lung-bioengineering-regeneration-lab/human_PCLS_BISQUE).  <a href="https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/288007639"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/288007639.svg" alt="DOI" style="height:20px;width:186px;"></a>
