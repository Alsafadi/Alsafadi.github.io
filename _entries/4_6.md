Luckily, I have recieved a minor revision on my first author paper. Interestingly, the revision came with no deadline, which is meant that we could give a proper revision.

There were two reviewers totalling 10 comments/questions most of which can be answered in text. Both reviewers were very positive and seemed to like the project very much. The second reviewer, specially, has complemented the paper and had some good questions. The last question of reviewer 2 was very interesting, but required an experiment to know the answer for sure. While this question could have been answered with speculations, it made more sense to actually to an experiment. THus, we decided to spend extra time on this manuscript to make sure we have addressed everything properly. 
The data obtained in this last experiment were spot on and actually strengthed the conclusions from that paper very well.

Typing up the rebuttal was a refreshing process for me. It allows me to talk about my research without any word limits, at least to the reviewers/editor. 

I think we were able to address all the remarks fairly well and I look forward to getting this paper published.
