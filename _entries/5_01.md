Eliora was my first full-time student during my PhD studies. I have trained a lot of people on the use and performance of several techniques. But this was the first time I had to train a student from scratch. Eliora is a second year bachelor student from the University Of Toronto (UofT) in Canada. She was selected to join a summer program at Lund University, we were content to host her at our lab. 

I trained her on several techniques such as immunoblotting, qPCR, and Luciferase reporter assays. I was impressed by the speed of which she had learned and her ability to digest new knowledge. 

I spun out a small project for her from my PhD project. Eliora explored the role of TGF-beta treatment on the activity of the co-transcriptional activators Yap/Taz in lung epithelial cells.

During her examination, the external examiners were impressed by her work. I felt so proud. 

I hope that I have done a good job as a supervisor, and hope to do the same with future students too.
