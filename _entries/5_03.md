I have been fortunate to be able to join two courses by the national bioinformatics infrastructure in Sweden (NBIS):

**2019 - SciLife Labs and NBIS: Omics Integration and Systems Biology. ** SciLifeLab/NBIS, Stockholm, Sweden

**2018 - RaukR 2018. Advanced R programming for Bioinformatics Summer School.** SciLifeLab/NBIS, Visby, GÃ¶tland, Sweden


I have used my experience and knowledge learned from these courses to get my colleagues started on using R. 
So far I have helped visiting PhD student Woijtek and LBR postDoc John Stegmayr.
