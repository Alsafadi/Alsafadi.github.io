We as a group, have organized a workshop for the WCMM school on 3D bio printing. 

Martina, a PhD student from LBR, has prepared a presentation for the student's on bioprinting. I have given them a practical workshop on how to make a 3D model and showed them how to print that using our modified MakerBot.
