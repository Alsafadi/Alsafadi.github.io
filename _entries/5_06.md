After having worked on the procurement of the cytation 5. I took on the responsibility of taking care of the device initially and make sure that everyone who is using it is trained. The device is such a complex machinary that is capable of many function. I would hate for it to get damaged for improper use. 

So far, I have given the basic training for several of my colleagues at the lab and students who are joining the laboratory briefly.

While this task of device care and maintenance will be passed on to someone else in the future. This experience has taught me a lot.
