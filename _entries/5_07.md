Pieter has joined us from Belgium at the end of his bachelor degree to do his traineeship. His program was for him to become a laboratory assistant/Manager.

I designed Pieter's project for him to help me with the optimization of subcellular fractionation from lung epithelial cells while ensuring mass spectrometry compatibility of the resulting sample. 

Pieter presented his thesis at his home country where he received a high grade.

**Title of Pieter's thesis: Optimization of subcellular fractionation of the lung epithelial cells as exploration of the Hippo signaling pathway.**


I think the amount of knowledge Pieter has gained through his internship is reflected in his thesis.
