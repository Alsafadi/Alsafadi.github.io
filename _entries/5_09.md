It was nice to train multiple students together. We received two highly motivated students from Spain. It was a great experinece to work with both of them.
I trained Pablo on plasmid preparataion and cell culture techniques, and I trained Laura on Bioinformatics analysis of transcription factor motifs and single cell RNAseq.
