It was nice to train multiple students together. We received two highly motivated students from Spain. It was a great experience to work with both of them.

I trained Pablo on plasmid preparation and cell culture techniques, and I trained Laura on Bioinformatics analysis of transcription factor motifs and single cell RNAseq.

Both of these students were highly motivated and managed to produce great project reports despite the fact that this was done during the pandemic. 

Laura worked mostly from her dorm room here and Pablo had to fit his schedule to make sure that he is only present in the lab when it is possible to follow all the guidelines for the pandemic. 

I am proud of both of them.
