The experience of training Laura and Pablo from Spain was very postitive. Their university was very content with their outcome so they have decided to send us more students.
We received another two highly motivated students from Spain: Inés Mínguez and Irene Urrecho.
Ines helped me with the optimization of Immunoprecipitation protocols to pulldown Yap/Taz from lung epithelial cells while maintaining mass spectrometry compatibility. Irene has worked with me on the CUT&RUN experiements and the bioinformatics analysis associated with these experiments. 

Next week is their last week and they will present their work at their university later on this summer. I am sure they both will do great.
