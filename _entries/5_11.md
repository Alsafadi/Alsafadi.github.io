The Miltenyi company has acquired the Blaze lightsheet microscope and they held a workshop in collaboration with Lund University BioImaging Center (LBIC) on 2021-11-18. During this workshop, I joined the event by organizing an interactive session for people to view lightsheet imaging using Virtual Reality on the Arivis Software.
