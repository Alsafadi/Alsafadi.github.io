The Miltenyi company has acquired the Blaze lightsheet microscope and they held a workshop in collaboration with Lund University BioImaging Center (LBIC) on 2021-11-18. During this workshop, I joined the event by organizing an interactive session for people to view lightsheet imaging using Virtual Reality on the Arivis Software.

This was an opportunity that presented itself suddenly. I have been setting up the Virtual Reality for our lab to explore lightsheet images we have obtained. I was going to attend this workshop as an attendee, however, I heard that the person organizing the VR part of the workshop was not available anymore. I proposed to the organizers that I can do it, and they were happy to include me in this workshop. 

I also chaired some of the talks in this workshop, which also has given me some more exposure.
