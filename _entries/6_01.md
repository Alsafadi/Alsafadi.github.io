Participation in conferences to present our science is a great experience that results in good interaction and visibility with the wider scientific community. But I always felt that it was not enough to just attend, so I always tried my best to be involved in some organizational aspect at the events that I go to. 

I feel that this has contributed greatly to my scientific career and my development as a whole. I was able to step out of the comfort zone and that has taught me a lot about communication and presence within the wider scientific community.

Here are some examples of my contributions to national/international conferences and meetings:

Year | Contribution | Conference | Location
