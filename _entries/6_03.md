**From Workshop organization to winning best poster presentation**

The vermont conference was wholesome for me as I managed to get involved in several aspects. It was full of great networking, amazing talks, and great discussions.

**Part A: Organized a workshop at the preconference day**
In collaboration with John Stegmayr, an LBR postDoc, we co-organized a training for precision cut lung slices (PCLS) at the Vermont conference 2019 in Burlington, VT, USA. 

We have done the session 3 times and had amazing interactive sessions with many scientists from across the world. 
This experience has effected my communication skills with scientists from various backgrounds.

**Part B: Presented a poster and Won best poster presentation**

I had a great pleasure in presenting this poster and discussing it with my colleagues. I was initially afraid of not getting enough interest from people, but it turned out much better than I thought. I have recieved great feedback and I thoroughly enjoyed the event.
