During my first visit to Linköping University to meet my collaborator and now PhD co-supervisor, Dr. Claudio Cantù, I was invited to present my project to the groups belonging to the same department as my hosts. It was very refreshing for me, since this was the first time I present this data outside of my field. None of the attendees were lung researchers, but I was very amazed by how excited everyone was to hear the talk and they asked several great questions afterwards. 

That visit was a success for me at various aspects of my career development. Which is discussed at various parts of the portfolio.
