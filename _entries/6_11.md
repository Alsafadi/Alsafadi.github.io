The lung science conference was held virtually this year. I have applied to present a poster and also applied for the bursary and won the bursary. The bursary covered registration costs and access to career development session. I had the career session with Dr. Sam Janes.

During this event, I have presented all the new data that I have obtained recently and I have recieved lots of great feedback. It was reassuring to see that attendees found value in my research.
