Finally, travel is now allowed and most of the restrictions are lifted. 
I applied to the EMIM conference to present my work on Lightsheet imaging of whole lungs and my abstract was selected for an oral talk. This conference was held in Thessaloniki, Greece.

I also received the LU travel grant to cover parts of the costs for this trip.
