I submitted my latest work to the LUnd Respiratory Network (LURN) and presented a poster at the event in Ystad, Sweden. 

During this event, I have presented all the new data that I have obtained recently and I have received lots of great feedback. It was reassuring to see that attendees found value in my research. 

Title of my poster: **Identification ofYap/Taz binding partners in the murine lung epithelium**
