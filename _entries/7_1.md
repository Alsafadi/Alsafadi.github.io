I have been selected to represent the WCMM center at strategic meeting the KAW foundation and Wallenberg family representatives.

The goal of this meeting was for the KAW foundation to receive updates from Lund as one of its more recent centers in order to decide the path forward and strategize their focus areas for future funding. 

THIS FELT LIKE A BIG DEAL. I honestly can say that this was one of the few times during my career in Sweden where I have witnessed a new level of professionalism. It is somewhat strange, but it was good exposure for me. I like being involved in strategic meetings as I think that I can voice a lot of the opinions of my peers. 

I think I did great during this meeting and was able to participate in the conversations in a positive manner.
