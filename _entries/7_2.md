Dr. Claudio Cantù is an expert in ChIP sequencing and CUT&RUN technologies. This collaboration with Dr. Cantù has resulted in him becoming a co-supervisor on my PhD. This collaboration continues to be very important for my PhD project.

This collaboration ended up being one of the most important ones for my project. We have managed to successfully implement the CUT&RUN technology for Yap/Taz in lung epithelial cells. This is normally very difficult to do for transcription factors, and even more difficult for co-factors like in our case. We managed to reproduce this across various samples of isolated primary alveolar type II cells.
