In the beginning of my PhD, I have co-organized a symposium on the use of precision cut lung slices (PCLS) in a collaboration between Lund University and Nottingham University. 

During this symposium, we have started a collaboration with Dr. Amanda Tatler to join forces on the topic. We are currently preparing a review article as part of this collaboration.
