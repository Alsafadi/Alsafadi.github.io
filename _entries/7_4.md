I just got invited directly to review a paper from a very respected lung journal :)

 

American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine

Dear Mr. Alsafadi:

The manuscript entitled "A Highly Phenotyped Open Access Repository of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Pluripotent Stem Cells" has been submitted to the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine and I am writing to invite you to serve as a reviewer. The information of the manuscript is attached at the end of this letter.



I am very excited to review this paper, but also a little nervous, I do not want to do any mistake.  I attached my review of this article.
