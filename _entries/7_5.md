My main supervisor, Darcy Wagner, has trained me to do peer-review of scientific articles through doing. Every time she has gotten a new paper to review that is related to my work, she would inform the editor of that journal and let me help her with that review. 
We would work on the peer review together by first analysis the paper separately, second intensely discuss all aspects of the peer, and third write the main major, minor comments.

This process has helped improve the way I think about experiment design and about how I write my own scientific work. 

Darcy always informs the editors of the trainees help so that the editors can recognize the expertise and maybe one day directly as a peer review.
