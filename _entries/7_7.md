I have recently developed a protocol to immunolabel a whole mouse lung and process it so it can be imaged using light-sheet microscopy to visualize specific molecular features within full murine lungs. We call the method:  inFLATION: **in**fusion of **F**luorescent **L**abelled **A**ntibodies in **T**issue of **I**ntact **O**rga**N**s

This technique have showed great success in wildtype lungs. I have presented this data at the EMIM conference in Greece as mentioned section 6. One of the main questions I have received about this technique was whether this protocol is able to image diseased lung where normal lung architecture is damaged. 

To address this question, we have collaborated with Dr. Irma Mahmutovic Persson, who is an expert on MRI and micro CT scans of rodent lungs for detection of lung fibrosis. In this collaboration, we have imaged the lungs using MRI micro CT and followed that by processing with our protocol to compare the imaging modules and to evaluate whether our protocol is capable of properly staining the diseased lung tissue.
