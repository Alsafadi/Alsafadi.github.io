This collaboration has developed over time to include several aspects. We do qPCR and immunoblotting in our lab and that's why Roberta, another PhD Student, and her PI Iben approached us for this collaboration. 

This collaboration started by providing my help to Roberta and her student Linda on qPCR of the gene Aquaporin 4 (Aqp4). I have trained both of them and helped Linda throughout the whole process of Data acquisition. 

The first version of the manuscript was not accepted. Thus, we decided to focus the manuscript on distinguishing between the different isotypes/variants of Aqp4. Thus, this collaboration grew further for us to design and validate new primers in addition to optimization of protein extraction from brain tissue and the immunoblotting of Aqp4.

If you ask me before going through this, how long it would take? I would have said it is very quick and painless. But the opposite has proved to be the case. Dealing with Aqp4 was very tricky and this collaboration took very long. 

Luckily, we were able to pull it off and optimize all the technical aspects for this study and the manuscript is now submitted again to a different journal.
