The NMT days were a great experience at many levels. 

We are given the opportunity to present our science to highschool students in terms they can understand. 

At the WCMM research school, we decided to participate as a group and prepare the whole presentation together and since I was one of the trainee-representatives, I had to drive this project and collate everything from everyone. 

It was an interesting experience so see people from several disciplines work on one topic and produce a popular version of the presentation. 

I presented the English version of this outreach. It was a great experience to see how the high school students are excited to learn about this topic (3D (bio)-printing in medicine)
