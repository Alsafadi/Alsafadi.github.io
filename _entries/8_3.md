On Thursday, Oct 15th, 2020. We will be recording while performing the 3D bio printing. This is part of a film about LBR that will be shared with the winder society to show them what we do.

While the video is an interview with our PI, Darcy, it has been a good learning opportunity to interact with the filming crew and talk them through what we are doing. The crew was very interested and I feel that they have learned a lot. 

Update: 
Here, you can watch the video.
