  <meta name="description" content="<p>The research process is complex one that is tailored and designed to address the questions given at hand. However, the research process is not limited to performing and executing experiments, but it includes all the necessary steps for a researcher to be able to perform the research. In this section, you will find selected reflection of the research process throughout the PhD:</p>
<p>This category encompasses the different aspects related to the methods used during my PhD. The entries selected here are either a demonstration of new techniques and methodologies I have learned, or reflections on the quality of the selected methods:</p>
<p>My PhD project was designed to include several state-of-the-arts techniques in order to identify the new relevant transcription factors. This required me to acquire several expertise through collaborations, courses, and interaction with the wider scientific community. Almost every single step of my project required an expertise that I did not have previously. In this section, the entries cover a various range for source of expertise:</p>
<p>I have been fortunate to go through the publication process prior to the start of the PhD. However, this process is variable based on the journal and the type of manuscript to be submitted. 
In this section I reflect on the publication process and list all my published contributions:</p>
<p>Teaching during the PhD can be accomplished through different ways. It is possible to do the classic in-class teaching of course or laboratory course, but also it is possible to teach through supervision. During my PhD, I have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Taught in workshops locally and internationally</li>
  <li>Supervised several international bachelor students</li>
  <li>Co-supervised a master thesis student</li>
  <li>Supervised master project for writing grants</li>
  <li>Reviewed grant applications by PhD students/Postdocs at the WCMM research school.</li>
  <li>Trained several people of different academic levels on the use of different technologies.</li>
</ul>

<p>This section includes a few examples of teaching and training I have performed during my PhD:</p>
<p>Conferences and seminars are among valuable parts of a scientist’s career. It is the direct interaction with other scientists that allows for the growth and development of someone’s abilities. If a person is does not discuss their project with others outside their environment, they will be limited in their approaches. These sort of meetings and interactions also offer several opportunities for finding collaborators.</p>

<p>During my PhD, I have been lucky to attend several conferences and various seminar series:</p>

<p>Collaborations are an important part of any scientific project. Collaborations among group members are the minimum type of collaboration every scientist can do. However, wider collaborations with other groups locally, nationally, or internationally are important to increase and promote innovation and creativity in one’s research.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the LU environment is quite diverse and international of sorts, thus it is already rich in diversity offering great opportunities for exchange in ideas and expertise. During my PhD I have managed to maintain a few collaborations locally at Lund.</p>

<p>Moreover, the wider research community in the rest of Sweden and other countries offer various opportunities for collaborations.</p>

<p>This section shows my approach with collaboration during the PhD:</p>
<p>While it is important to focus on our research, it is as important to communicate what we are doing with the winder society. I am mainly interested in the translational research because it could potentially influence the lives of patients.
During my PhD, I have had several opportunities to share my work with the wider community:</p>
<p>Since we deal with patient material and animals in our projects, several ethical issues have to be considered to avoid any harm to anyone. While different projects have different levels of ethical discussion, I do believe that all projects without exception must have some ethical issues to discuss.</p>

<p>We continuously discuss ethical issues in my group and address all issues at they appear.</p>
<p>There are several career paths that can be taken after the PhD. When I started my PhD, I thought that the academic track is the one that I will take moving forward. However, throughout the PhD, I have changed my perspective a lot and learned a lot more about other career tracks that can suit me.</p>
<p>Supervision styles vary greatly between supervisors and supervisees. I think it is a challenge to find out what supervision style suites a person best, but also the style that you prefer as a supervisee.</p>

<p>I consider myself to be generally independant and I prefer to get my supervisor involved when I think I cannot figure out the task myself. Of course, the timing of this process is very important that time isn’t wasted in the meanwhile. I discuss this topic in details with my main PhD supervisor every year at our annual meeting. Usually we analyse the previous year and make decisions for moving forward.</p>

<p>This section contains a few of my reflections on supervision:</p>
<p>During the PhD studies, I have been involved in several administrative/leadership activities. I think it is important to train in that manner as the amount of these activities increase as you move forward in your career. 
My approach during the whole PhD has been: Be involved in at least one non-phd-project related activity at all times.</p>

<p>The following entries will cover some of the various administrative, organizational, and leadership roles:</p>

        <p>The research process is complex one that is tailored and designed to address the questions given at hand. However, the research process is not limited to performing and executing experiments, but it includes all the necessary steps for a researcher to be able to perform the research.

              <p>As you walk in the hallways of BMC, it is amazing how many internationals you see from all cultures and places. It is inspiring to see everyone working so well together.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, few struggles and obstacles come with being international: The migration issues!!!</p>

<p>I have been lucky to be able to join the lab as a visiting student before transition and becoming a PhD student. While I was on a scholarship, I was on a visiting residence permit, but I had to change that to a student residence permit when my PhD studies started.</p>

<p>The process has been quite challenging as I was asked to leave the country for this switch. Now, I was lucky to still have a permit to go to Germany, but if I did not, I cannot begin to think what I could do. I am from Gaza, Palestine and going back there is not possible at the time.</p>

<p>Luckily, things worked out and I started my position. However, I think the HR department at the University should reflect on how much preparation they need when they hire an international verses hiring a local. There could have been a lot of things improved in that regard.</p>

              Individual Reflection: Admission to PhD studies in Sweden
            </a>

            <div class="entrycontent" id="c1-2" style="display:none;">

              <div class="entrydate"></div>

              <p>After I had completed my bachelor’s degree in biochemistry, I was not sure about my career goals and what direction I should take. Thus, I started examining the different options. I ended up joining a research group where I learned a lot of techniques and my research interest has started to grow. Then, I knew that I wanted a career in academic research. Thus, doing a PhD is a step in the right direction for a career as an academic researcher. I chose to follow the PhD program at Lund University because of my research interests. I have been in the field of lung fibrosis for the past two years and I am happy that now I can pursue a PhD in it now.</p>

<p>Honestly, there is not much alternatives I would see myself in at this point. I enjoy doing academic research and I feel very confident with the choices I have made. But to reflect on the “What if?” question. There are few alternatives I could have been doing now. My original educational track was to pursue medical school and eventually train as a physician. To this end, even after I finish the PhD program, I may still pursue this goal. Alternatively, I could have been working in a pharmaceutical company as a technician or in project management. If I had chosen this path, I may have been much happier with the time spent on the job and the quality of my life outside the professional brackets. However, I am sure I would not have been happy doing such work. It is true that I spend quite a lot of time at work daily, but I am generally content with how intellectually stimulated most of the time.</p>

<p>I do like to multi-task. This means that I like to carry on several projects the same time. This, of course, results in a heterogenous efficiency rates for each project. However, this methodology offers me an escape once I face a struggle in each project. I find it very helpful to immediately switch to a different task when I am stuck on one. Someone might say that this would create a lot of confusion and it would decrease effectiveness. This is possible at times of course, but generally it has been working well for me.</p>

<p>I expect myself to be the main driver of my project. This being said, I expect my supervisors to be reasonably available when I get stuck in areas where I lack experience. It is more important for me that the supervisors help me identify areas of knowledge and learning outcomes rather than to direct to specifically what I must do. I already receive a lot of supervision on weekly basis that is driven by my needs. I have not faced any problems this far. My supervisors may not always be experts in specific techniques I would like to pursue, thus my expectation in this case would be that the supervisors help establish new collaborations with persons who are able to teach and supervise me in such occasions. I luckily work in a multi-disciplinary environment where additional help is easily accessible.</p>

<p>I generally prefer to handle everything on my own. This of course has many interpretations and implications. As I said earlier, I prefer to be the main driver of my project. But of course, I will not be able to accomplish any of my work without the help of my supervisors. I am sure that there will be a lot of administrative hurdles that I would not be able to deal with myself. A discussion point in the intro to PhD course was the writing of a manuscript. I realized people have widely different opinions on how it should be done. In my opinion, if I am the first author of a paper, I should be responsible of the way the paper is written. Of course, I may lack the experience to produce a good manuscript. The role of my supervisor should be to direct me to produce a good one rather than to do it for me.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I mostly fear to manage the administrative hurdles. Part of my goals during the PhD is to learn how to manage administrative tasks and so. But I can foresee difficulties in that regard. I am certain that my supervisors will be able to help me overcome any hurdles.</p>

<p>The course requirements for the PhD program add up to 26,5 hp. The compulsory courses are: Introductory course, Oral communication, Research Ethics, Theory and Practice of Scientific Communication, Knowledge in collaboration - how free research creates values in society, Applied Qualitative Methodology, Applied Statistics I &amp; II, Laboratory Animal Science. Comprehensive Generic Skills (Portfolio), and One elective course. So far, I have followed the Introductory course and Laboratory Animal Science.</p>

<p>As for the extra course work, I plan to take as many of the teaching non-compulsory courses such as problem-based learning. I intend to continue in an academic career, thus it is important for me to take these courses when I can.</p>

<p>I do think internationalization is very important. In fact, I am not from here and Sweden is the 5th country I live in to pursue my academic career. I can say that without this international experience, I would have not been the same person at all. Overall, experiences are what make us who were. So, the same goes for the PhD program, internationalization in this case would entail going abroad to different labs to learn and share knowledge across. I do plan to take parts of my PhD to go to different labs in different countries to achieve different goals.</p>

<p>I believe that my choices this far have been aligned with my future goals of pursuing a career as an academic researcher. But this is only the beginning. Anything could happen. But I am positive that I am on the right track for my career.</p>

              <p>We have faced several challenges in the building of a new lab when we moved to Sweden, but it feels great to have gotten this far. Our older location at BMC C12 was not sufficient to house all our needs for experimental space and equipment. Luckily, we have found a new location at BMC B10. Now that we are moving, it feels like a fresh beginning.</p>

<p>This time we have more space and we already have most of what we need. It is very interesting to have to participate in the thought process of where things should go. Every piece is placed where it is for a reason, so it can be utilized for the best.</p>

<p>This is a unique learning opportunity as most PhD students do not get to contribute to the environment they perform their research.</p>

              <p>It is a privilege to have the opportunity to apply for grants to join international conferences. I think this experience is very important for pursuing the research process. Later in my career, I will be applying a lot more for grants.</p>

<p>I have been accepted to present a poster at the Keystone Conference on Signaling dynamics and Cellular plasticity  in Keystone, Colorado, USA. This conference is great for me as it is multidisciplinary and there is a lot to learn from all the fields and to apply in my field.</p>

<p>I applied for the Fysiografen grant and I was awarded 16 000 SEK  to cover some of the conference costs.</p>

<p><strong>Update: 2019-09-01</strong>
To complete the process of handling grants, I have submitted a grant report that describes my activities. <a href="/assets/files/Grant_Report.pdf"><strong>Download Here!</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>Update: 2022-05-01</strong>
I have applied to the fysiografen research grants twice after: Once rejected and later another accepted. See reflection in this section. <a href="#s10" onclick="navigate('#s10')"> <strong>See also reflection on the rejection in the Career Developement Section.</strong></a></p>

              <p>My halftime was done on the 28th of October 2020. This was at the beginning of the period in which the university started implementing distancing rules and limiting the number of people that can be in a room.</p>

<p>We held the half time at Dora Jakobson in BMC D15 and the only people present were the opponents and PhD supervisors. Everyone else was invited to join on Zoom. While this aspect was new to us, it was also a great opportunity for me to have my family (from Gaza) join us in the half time.</p>

<p><strong>Choice of opponents.</strong> My opponents was Dr. Johan Jakobsson and Dr. Filipe Pereira, both of which are outside the lung field. The choice of the opponents was strategic for several reasons. First, the expertise of the opponents is very important to advance my PhD studies; Dr. Jakobsson has a great expertise in stem cells and chromatin modifications which is perfect for me since I have started working with Cleavage under target and release under nuclease (CUT&amp;RUN), and Dr. Pereira is an expert in cell reprogramming and transcription factors role in stem cells and cell reprogramming. My focus of the PhD is on identifying context-relevant transcription factors in the stem cells of the lung epithelium that my play a role in fibrosis.</p>

<p><strong>The aftermath</strong> I felt very good during the presentation and managed to comfortably explain all the different aspects of my PhD studies. (<a href="/assets/files/halftime_papers.pdf"><strong>list of planned papers at the time</strong></a>). I was able to have a good conversation with my opponents that was focused on the bigger picture an the relevance of my project, rather than experimental details of the different experiments. To me, this indicates that the quality of the experiments was high.</p>

<p>I hope that I will be able to complete my PhD despite the spread of the corona virus. While Sweden is not shutting down completely like other countries, we are already seeing changes in the dynamics of the different facilities and labs at the university.</p>

              <p>I have so far applied to three grants to the Royal Physiographic Society (Fysiografen). I was lucky to receive the first one which was a travel grant with amount 16 000SEK. The second one was a research grant that was rejected. The third was another research grant that was accepted luckily and I received 50 000SEK towards my research project.</p>

<p>There are a few similarities and differences between the two research grants. Here are the most important aspect that I think contributed to the decision of each grant:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Timing.</strong> I applied for the rejected grant before my halftime review, and the one accepted was one year after the halftime. The fysiografen states that they give priority to PhD students who complete their halftime. While I was aware of this, I decided to apply anyways in order to practice research grant writing. Unfortunately, there weren’t any feedback given with the rejection.</li>
  <li><strong>Amount.</strong> The first grant that was rejected was supposed to go towards the purchase of a plate reader that potentially was going to cost 400 tSEK. The second grant was to cover the costs associated with mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics and the application totaled to 100 tSEK approximately. The grant call does not specify the amount to apply for, however, I can imagine that the first grant was over what the fysiografen usually awards PhD students. I have observed after being awarded the second grant that the fysiografen usually awards 50 tSEK to PhD students and 80 tSEK to PostDoc. Therefore, I think the fact that the first application was very high in amount, it may have discouraged the reviewers to consider it.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiments vs. equipment.</strong> It seems to me that this type of grant is more suitable for research projects that are specific to experiments rather than equipment. While the design of the project for the first (rejected) grant included specific experiments using the specialized plate reader, the costs associated with that project was to planned to cover the costs of the device. Since this is a smaller grant, the fact that the granting agency gives less money may make it more difficult for them to consider a grant application for an individual piece of equipment that may have a large cost.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I think this was a positive experience in general and I do think that my grant writing skills have improved through the PhD. This improvement is a result of grant applications and also helping my supervisor with larger grant applications.</p>

              <p>This Year I am going to have three bachelor students simoltanously and will co-supervise 1 master student.</p>

<p>Out of the three bachelor students, two are from the Universidad Francisco de Vitoria in Spain: Laura and Pablo. <a href="#s5" onclick="navigate('#s5')"> <strong>See teaching section below.</strong></a>. And the third student Pieter is from Balgium. For Laura and Pablo, I needed to provide their University and Erasmus with a project plan before they come for their internship. For pieter on the other hand, the project plan was to be done after his arrival.</p>

<p>I have done this previously with Eliora who interned with me for 10 weeks in the summer of 2019. For Eliora, we have done a back and forth feedback to generate the project plan. This process was very useful for both of us as I managed to explain all the necessary information for her and easily identify the gaps in knowledge to be able to come up with the plan. On the other hand for Laura and Pablo, due to the time limitation, I have firs designed their project plan with the intention to go through it on more time with them when they are here. This way, they can apply for erasmus scholarship and also get to learn how to improve project plans afterwards.</p>

<p>Both of these projects were spun out of my PhD project but were made specific enough so the students get to generate new novel data and experience the research process from beginning to end.</p>

              <p>I just received an email with the approval letter for my most recent application to use the SNIC local storage cluster.</p>

<p>This is my 6th application to be approved in association with LUNARC computation cluster.</p>

<p>This resource, especially, has been very instrumental throughout my PhD and is very important for anyone doing computation. We are lucky to have access to such resources at no extra cost. The only thing we need to do, is apply.</p>

<p>The application process for this is very comprehensive as it requires you to explain how the computation cluster is needed for your specific project. More importantly, you apply as the PI which is of course more responsibility, but a great learning opportunity.</p>

<p>Examples of application and report submitted after completion of project:</p>

              ChIP Seq vs. CUT&RUN

              <p>ChIP sequencing has been a central technique on genome wide analyses and its quality is mainly dictated by the quality of the antibodies used in the analysis. The antibodies we have for you Yap/Taz have been validated in our hands and by others and are considered of good quality. One major drawback of ChIP sequencing method is the number of cells required to achieve high quality reads. While the number of distal epithelial cells isolated from an individual mouse could be sufficient for a ChIP seq experiment, the number of proximal epithelial cells is highly limited and would not suffice for ChIP. To address this limitation, a new method has been developed, Cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&amp;RUN), that manages to release the targeted sequences that are cleaved directly but the attached nuclease for paired end DNA sequencing. CUT&amp;RUN requires a very small number of cells as low as 1000 cells. As Yap/Taz do not directly bind to DNA, the antibody bound nuclease could end up far from the DNA to cleave it.</p>

<p>This work is done at the lab of Dr. Claudio Cantu at Linköping University who is a co-supervisor of my PhD studies. Dr. Cantu is an expert in mass spec proteomics, ChIPseq and CUT&amp;RUN and he has applied similar workflows previously on Wnt/β-catenin signalling.</p>

              <p>Oxana Klementieva is a PI on our floor in BMC B10.</p>

<p>Oxana does a lot of advanced imaging at the different synchrotrons here in Lund, at MAXIV or our in other countries. She has her samples mounted on these special glass circular sample holders that are so sensitive. She told me about how difficult it is to transfer these samples all the time. We discussed the issue and found a solution that we could 3D- print. I designed a sample holder for these samples, and it seems to have fixed the issue. It is refreshing to fix daily issues with out-of-the-box solutions.</p>

              Single Cell RNAseq vs. Deconvolution of Bulk RNAseq
            </a>

            <div class="entrycontent" id="c2-5" style="display:none;">

              <div class="entrydate"><i class="fa-regular fa-calendar-days"></i> 2022-01-31</div>

              <p>Single cell RNAseq has revolutionized the way we understand cell diversity in all tissues and resulted in the discovery of several celltypes during homeostasis or disease. Some transitional cell states were discovered using this technology. However, there are a few limitations of the technology that may effect the ability to detect specific cell populations. First, the method of which the single cell suspension is obtained effects whether all cell types are being presented. An example, in almost all the available lung single cell datasets, there is an overrepresentation of macrophages as these cells are easily captured in comparison to interstitial cells that could potentially become damaged during the process of their dissociation. Furthermore, the sequencing depth of single cell is very limited in comparison to bulk techniques. An example, some single cell data sets only contain few hundreds to a couple of thousand features while a bulk sample can contain more than 25000 features. This is due to the difficulty in recovering many of the less abundant transcripts in the single cells obtained.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the bulk RNAseq usually does not discriminate against different cell types as there is no need for dissociation of cells in order to sequence the sample. Moreover, the depth of the bulk RNAseq is only limited by the amount of reads you choose to sequence. But the bulk RNAseq is limited in the fact that you cannot learn much about the cellular resolution and cell type distribution of the sample at hand. For this purpose, deconvolution bioinformatics pipelines have been implemented and developed to translate the bulk data into the celltypes that makes up that tissue based on a reference single cell dataset obtained from the same type of tissue sample.</p>

<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to using deconvolution. First, there is a concern that the deconvolution algorithms may not capture the true amount of cells. To this end, several studies have been done where they perform bulk RNAseq and single cell RNASeq on cell samples with known proportions of celltypes. The deconvolution in these studies have been shown to work with a great accuracy.</p>

<p>The cost associated with experiments is of course another important aspect to consider when doing these experiments. Single cell RNASeq is very expensive and may not always be necessary.</p>

<p>A great example is one of my first author manuscript. I have developed a cell isolation protocol to obtain proximal and distal lung epithelial progenitors from an individual mouse. To validate these cells we differentiated them into organoids in 3D culture. To evaluate the cell diversity of the cell pellet we isolate from the mice, we did bulk RNAseq and deconvoluted the data using a published reference dataset.</p>

<p>While this part of the project has grown overtime during the PhD, I do not think that single cell RNAseq would have been able to improve the outcome of the study greatly. The assumption is that single cell will be better, however the high cost associated and the uncertainty surrounding whether we capture all cells make it less justifiable to perform a single cell RNAseq experiment.</p>

<p>Technologies like these usually become cheaper overtime, maybe a reflection like this would have not been needed if this was a cheap experiment.</p>

              <p>I needed to perform several experiments where a magnetic rack is needed. I did not like the fact that all available magnetic racks require you to either place all your sample on or off the rack without the option of keeping some samples on and some off temporarily. Therefore, I decided to design my own rack that does exactly what I needed to do, and the cost of 3D printing and magnets would not amount to 10th of the cost of a commercial rack.</p>

<p>I have printed this rack and have used it for more than two years.</p>

              <p>The success of the main aim of my PhD project (Identification of relevant transcription factors that are Yap/Taz partners) is highly dependent on the ability to perform a sequence of experiments successfully. This includes:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Primary cell isolation of proximal and distal lung epithelial cells.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Performing Cleavage under target and run under nuclease (CUT&amp;RUN) on these cells.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Perform subcellular fractionation on the primary cells.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Perform pulldown of Yap/Taz containing complexes on the subfractionated samples.</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> Perform Mass spectrometry proteomics on the pulled down samples.</p>

<p>Step 1 was optimized and the developed protocol has been submitted as a first author manuscript which is under-review currently. 
Step 2 has been optimized in collaboration with PhD supervisor in Linköping, Dr. Claudio Cantù. This is discussed in another entry in this section.</p>

<p>There are several established protocols for steps 3 and 4, however most of them use harsh chemicals that interfere with step 5. Thus, there was a need for optimization for these steps for compatibility with later steps. 
I took the opportunity to optimize these steps and teach two students in the meanwhile. Bachelor student Pieter Plattiau from Belgium trained with me and we optimized step3 and bachelor student Inés Mínguez from Spain trained with me to optimize the Pulldown in step 4. Now we are ready to run all the mass spec.</p>

      <h4> 03. SUBJECT EXPERTISE</h4>

      <div class="entrydescription">
        
        <p>My PhD project was designed to include several state-of-the-arts techniques in order to identify the new relevant transcription factors. This required me to acquire several expertise through collaborations, courses, and interaction with the wider scientific community. Almost every single step of my project required an expertise that I did not have previously. In this section, the entries cover a various range for source of expertise:</p>

              <p>In order to be able to manage the bioinformatics analysis during my PhD. I took the approach of learning how to do the different bioinformatics pipelines on my own. I have had programming experience previously, but I only started doing data analysis during the PhD. I taught myself how to use the statistical software R through online courses, guidelines, and practice. Following that, I took some advanced courses with NBIS.</p>

<p>NBIS has been a great source of training for me where I have learned a lot about bioinformatics analysis. I think I have developed my skills a lot with the courses I have taken there:</p>

<p><strong>SciLife Labs and NBIS: Omics Integration and Systems Biology</strong>
SciLifeLab/NBIS, Stockholm, Sweden</p>

<p><strong>RaukR 2018. Advanced R programming for Bioinformatics Summer School</strong>
SciLifeLab/NBIS, Visby, Götland, Sweden</p>

<p>In addition to these course, doing work with own datasets is maybe the most rewarding and best approch to learn bioinformatics.</p>

<p>Now at the end of the PhD, I have developed several pipelines for RNAseq, single cell RNAseq, DNAseq, CUT&amp;RUN, ChIPseq, TAXONOMY, and more. I think I have a huge appreciation for bioinformatics, artificial intellegence, and machine learning that I plan to do choose career path that heavily uses bioinformatics.</p>

<p>I do enjoy programming a lot. This is why I have designed this page from scratch to display my PhD protfolio.</p>

              <p>I have had some experience previously with primary cell isolation from mouse and human. However, there was a substantial need to learn more to achieve proper isolation from the various types of lung epithelial tissues.</p>

<p><em>Dr. Oskar Hallgren - HBEC isolation</em>
Dr. Hallgren is a senior scientist who has joined our WCMM partner Dr. Sandra Lindstedt. Dr. Hallgren has been very instrumental in helping us set up the isolation protocols for the human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs). Dr. Hallgren has been working in this field for a long time and it is a privilege to have someone to seek their advice.</p>

<p>For primary mouse cell isolation. I needed to improve the current technology in order to be able to isolate primary proximal and distal lung epithelial cells from the same individual mouse. I managed to make a methodological advance using 3D-printing and generated a surgical guide that aids this technique. This has become one of my first author manuscripts and is currently under review. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.10.491312v1.abstract"><strong>Check out the BioRxiv</strong></a></p>

<p>Dr. Leigh is the newest WCMM fellow who joined Lund University recently to start his own lab. Dr. Leigh explores mechanisms of limb regeneration in the Axolotl. I met Dr. Leigh the first time at the Keystone conference in 2019 when he was a PostDoc in Harvard. It is great to have him around.</p>

<p>Dr. Leigh has been helping me a lot in navigating single cell datasets and also bulk RNAseq datasets. Having fresh eyes from a different field is very helpful.</p>

<p>Moreover, Dr. Leigh helped me get started with Deconvolution of bulk RNAseq using reference single cell RNAseq datasets.</p>

              <p>Mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics is needed for my project in order to analyze the proteins that are pulled down with Yap/Taz to validate the finding from CUT&amp;RUN.</p>

<p>I have started to learn the technique early on during my PhD and have done a trial run with <em>Dr. Neserin Ali</em> in 2019 to learn the technique.</p>

<p>While it is an exciting technique, I think it is more beneficial to me to acquire MS data through collaboration rather than try to the analysis myself. I think I have done enough to be able to understand the technique and the data that comes out of it. However, it will not be a technique that I want to go in depth with in the future. Thus, the best approach is to do it through collaborations.</p>

<p>Imaging of 3D models is very important and we wanted to attempt at visualizing the mouse lung in 3D by imaging with fluorescence. Thus, we developed the necessary protocols to do it with light-sheet fluorescence microscopy that allows for larger sample size without destroying the sample with the lasers.</p>

              <p>Lightsheet microscopy produces amazing large 3D images. While the amount of data is huge, it presents a challenge for data analysis. Attempting to analyze large 3D images using a normal screen in 2D has proved to be difficult.</p>

<p>We have looked into virtual reality to analysis 3D images. Luckily, a software has been developed by researchers to do this exact job: SyGlass. I have heard about this software through Dr. Shamit Soneji and I got in contact with the CEO of the company Michael Morehead.</p>

<p>Michael has been super helpful and has guided us through this technology very well. We do have the software license now and we are analyzing our data using it. Hopefully, we will be able to publish these analyses in the near future.</p>

              <p>While most journals have different guidelines for their paper submission, the process of putting a manuscript together is fairly similar all across.</p>

<p>The bioRxivs has offered the ability to share the manuscript before it has been reviewed. This gives a great advantage for researchers to get feedback from the wider scientific community and also claim credit for their work.</p>

<p>The lack of peer review is of course a concern with regards to the quality of the work posted. However, the fact that there isn’t peer-review encourages all the readers to be more critical while reading these papers.</p>

<p>We have submitted my manuscript on dual cell isolation to the journal Stem Cell Reports. In the meanwhile, we also decided to submit to bioRxivs so we share this protocol with the community in order to get feedback on it.</p>

<p>The submission process was simple and straight forward. It is not very similar to the process of submitting to the various journals; it is a simplified version of the submission process.</p>

              <p>Publishing a review paper is very different from publishing primary research articles. While in a primary article you perform a mini-review in the introduction, writing a full review paper requires a lot more work in order to capture all the necessary information. When the field is growing, it is very important to make sure that you do not miss out on any publications that are related to the review question.</p>

<p>This process was very demanding and required a high level of organization to keep track of all references.</p>

<p>Moreover, an interesting procedure is the fact that you have to sometimes apply for permission to use your own figures that have been previously published in some journals. This is of course unfortunate, and I think journals should pay attention to the authors’ rights to improve publishing conditions.</p>

              <p>While this paper will not be included in my thesis. It has been one of these collaborations that took a huge effort from all authors to get it accepted in Nature.</p>

<p>It is really interesting the amount of work needed to get a paper into these high impact factor journals. I honestly think that it is highly unreasonable. Unfortunately, publishing in high IF journals gives authors advantages when it comes to grant applications or recruitment. I do not think the science will be any less of quality if it was published in lower impact journals. I think what matters at the end is how often the article will be used by others regardless of its IF.</p>

              <p>It is amazing how technology has improved many aspects of data analysis and how we do research. Bioinformatics is very complex and can be used in so many ways to create complex mathamatics on the data and create complex graphics that present this data one way or another.</p>

<p><strong>BUT …</strong>  The rise of bioinformatics comes with issues and challenges that the different scientific societies need to adapt to.</p>

<p>One aspect that I would like to reflect on here is <em>reproducibility</em>. An improving aspect of bioinformatics that may not always be properly checked.</p>

<p>Sharing the code of which you have written to produce the data graphs you publish is becoming more and more common, and even a requirement in most journals. Which is GREAT!!! However, are the codes that are shared really reviewed?</p>

<p>Part of my PhD studies consisted of implementing several bioinformatics workflows that required me to establish snippets of code that has previosuly been published. And to my disappointment, only a small percentage of published code, can be easily reporducible. Which is SAD.</p>

<p><strong>Why does this happen?</strong></p>

<p>One problem is the limitations imposed by the journals on the number of charecters, words, or materials associated with the paper. It is usally very difficult to summarize all the bioinformatics that you have performed in a few words. In fact, most of the codes I have written (with minimal annotation) ends up being in the hundreds of lines of code. Sometimes, a single figure can take 1 line and some other times 120 lines. Of course, this issue is easily being addressed by referencing a link to the data repository/code on github an example that has no limits like the journal limits. However, this has few issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Most journals do not have the capacity&lt;&gt; to review code. They probably do not even look it. This is something that will need to be fixed in the future, as responsible research requires sharing enough information for reproducibility.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Code in repos can be changed after a paper has been published. Github, an example, keeps tracks of all the changes that occur. But not everyone is able to work with github to understand which part has been modified. Moreover, these repos can be taken down and there no way to control that. One solution to this issue is to publish code releases and share them with articles instead of links to the repos. This way the version of the code is the same as when an article is published, even if there is a newer version of the code. But, as you can already expect, most people do not do that either.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>But I am happy that the tools to do this properly exist, even if they are not implemented. It is possible and recommended to be on the good side of this.</p>

<p>There is a tool called Zenodo, which is almost like a journal of open source code. You post a specific release of your code and you get a DOI.. Yes, you get a DOI.. which is then citable in your paper. While this is relative new, and still needs a lot of work. I think it is going in a great direction.</p>

<p>I try my best to always annotate my code properly and get it publicly released properly. Here are some examples of my code contribution:</p>

              <p>Luckily, I have recieved a minor revision on my first author paper. Interestingly, the revision came with no deadline, which is meant that we could give a proper revision.</p>

<p>There were two reviewers totalling 10 comments/questions most of which can be answered in text. Both reviewers were very positive and seemed to like the project very much. The second reviewer, specially, has complemented the paper and had some good questions. The last question of reviewer 2 was very interesting, but required an experiment to know the answer for sure. While this question could have been answered with speculations, it made more sense to actually to an experiment. THus, we decided to spend extra time on this manuscript to make sure we have addressed everything properly. 
The data obtained in this last experiment were spot on and actually strengthed the conclusions from that paper very well.</p>

<p>Typing up the rebuttal was a refreshing process for me. It allows me to talk about my research without any word limits, at least to the reviewers/editor.</p>

<p>I think we were able to address all the remarks fairly well and I look forward to getting this paper published.</p>

      <h4> 05. TEACHER TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE</h4>

      <div class="entrydescription">
        
        <p>Teaching during the PhD can be accomplished through different ways. It is possible to do the classic in-class teaching of course or laboratory course, but also it is possible to teach through supervision. During my PhD, I have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Taught in workshops locally and internationally</li>
  <li>Supervised several international bachelor students</li>
  <li>Co-supervised a master thesis student</li>
  <li>Supervised master project for writing grants</li>
  <li>Reviewed grant applications by PhD students/Postdocs at the WCMM research school.</li>
  <li>Trained several people of different academic levels on the use of different technologies.</li>
</ul>

<p>This section includes a few examples of teaching and training I have performed during my PhD:</p>

              <p>Eliora was my first full-time student during my PhD studies. I have trained a lot of people on the use and performance of several techniques. But this was the first time I had to train a student from scratch. Eliora is a second year bachelor student from the University Of Toronto (UofT) in Canada. She was selected to join a summer program at Lund University, we were content to host her at our lab.</p>

<p>I trained her on several techniques such as immunoblotting, qPCR, and Luciferase reporter assays. I was impressed by the speed of which she had learned and her ability to digest new knowledge.</p>

<p>I spun out a small project for her from my PhD project. Eliora explored the role of TGF-beta treatment on the activity of the co-transcriptional activators Yap/Taz in lung epithelial cells.</p>

<p>During her examination, the external examiners were impressed by her work. I felt so proud.</p>

<p>I hope that I have done a good job as a supervisor, and hope to do the same with future students too.</p>

              <p>Although, decellularization is not the main technique in my PhD studies. Being in the LBR, I have learned it early on, and I will utilize it in the later parts of my PhD.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, I have helped in running the WCMM research school workshop on decellularization.</p>

              <p>After having worked on the procurement of the cytation 5. I took on the responsibility of taking care of the device initially and make sure that everyone who is using it is trained. The device is such a complex machinery that is capable of many function. I would hate for it to get damaged for improper use.</p>

<p>So far, I have given the basic training for several of my colleagues at the lab and students who are joining the laboratory briefly.</p>

<p>While this task of device care and maintenance will be passed on to someone else in the future. This experience has taught me a lot.</p>

              <p>It was nice to train multiple students together. We received two highly motivated students from Spain. It was a great experience to work with both of them.</p>

<p>I trained Pablo on plasmid preparation and cell culture techniques, and I trained Laura on Bioinformatics analysis of transcription factor motifs and single cell RNAseq.</p>

<p>Both of these students were highly motivated and managed to produce great project reports despite the fact that this was done during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Laura worked mostly from her dorm room here and Pablo had to fit his schedule to make sure that he is only present in the lab when it is possible to follow all the guidelines for the pandemic.</p>

<p>I am proud of both of them.</p>

              <p>The experience of training Laura and Pablo from Spain was very postitive. Their university was very content with their outcome so they have decided to send us more students.
We received another two highly motivated students from Spain: Inés Mínguez and Irene Urrecho.
Ines helped me with the optimization of Immunoprecipitation protocols to pulldown Yap/Taz from lung epithelial cells while maintaining mass spectrometry compatibility. Irene has worked with me on the CUT&amp;RUN experiements and the bioinformatics analysis associated with these experiments.</p>

<p>Next week is their last week and they will present their work at their university later on this summer. I am sure they both will do great.</p>

<p>This was an opportunity that presented itself suddenly. I have been setting up the Virtual Reality for our lab to explore lightsheet images we have obtained. I was going to attend this workshop as an attendee, however, I heard that the person organizing the VR part of the workshop was not available anymore. I proposed to the organizers that I can do it, and they were happy to include me in this workshop.</p>

<p>I also chaired some of the talks in this workshop, which also has given me some more exposure.</p>

      <h4> 06. CONFERENCES AND SEMINARS</h4>

      <div class="entrydescription">
        
        <p>Conferences and seminars are among valuable parts of a scientist’s career. It is the direct interaction with other scientists that allows for the growth and development of someone’s abilities. If a person is does not discuss their project with others outside their environment, they will be limited in their approaches. These sort of meetings and interactions also offer several opportunities for finding collaborators.</p>

<p>During my PhD, I have been lucky to attend several conferences and various seminar series:</p>

              <p>Participation in conferences to present our science is a great experience that results in good interaction and visibility with the wider scientific community. But I always felt that it was not enough to just attend, so I always tried my best to be involved in some organizational aspect at the events that I go to.</p>

<p>I feel that this has contributed greatly to my scientific career and my development as a whole. I was able to step out of the comfort zone and that has taught me a lot about communication and presence within the wider scientific community.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of my contributions to national/international conferences and meetings:</p>

              <p>The keystone symposia on Signal Dynamics and Signal Integration in Development and Disease was very instrumental to my doctoral studies. the conference was in tandem with another symposia on Cellular plasticity which exposed me to more opportunities to interact with more fields related to my topic of study.</p>

<p>I presented a poster on the role of Yap/Taz in lung epithelial cells and their effects in alterations of the extracellular matrix. I have received great feedback on my project and was able to move forward with the project.</p>

<p>During the conference, I was able to meet several peers who are also in their graduate careers. I was able to exchange some protocols with them. Some of which I am currently working on implementing in my laboratory. The fact that this was a multidisciplinary meeting gave me the opportunity to expand my knowledge on understand the benefits of my work in a bigger picture. Finally, I was able to meet and interact with several pioneers in stem cell and developmental signaling research that may be a source of new collaborations in the future.</p>

              <p><strong>From Workshop organization to winning best poster presentation</strong></p>

<p>The vermont conference was wholesome for me as I managed to get involved in several aspects. It was full of great networking, amazing talks, and great discussions.</p>

<p><strong>Part A: Organized a workshop at the preconference day</strong>
In collaboration with John Stegmayr, an LBR postDoc, we co-organized a training for precision cut lung slices (PCLS) at the Vermont conference 2019 in Burlington, VT, USA.</p>

<p>We have done the session 3 times and had amazing interactive sessions with many scientists from across the world. 
This experience has effected my communication skills with scientists from various backgrounds.</p>

<p><strong>Part B: Presented a poster and Won best poster presentation</strong></p>

<p>I had a great pleasure in presenting this poster and discussing it with my colleagues. I was initially afraid of not getting enough interest from people, but it turned out much better than I thought. I have recieved great feedback and I thoroughly enjoyed the event.</p>

              <p>During my first visit to Linköping University to meet my collaborator and now PhD co-supervisor, Dr. Claudio Cantù, I was invited to present my project to the groups belonging to the same department as my hosts. It was very refreshing for me, since this was the first time I present this data outside of my field. None of the attendees were lung researchers, but I was very amazed by how excited everyone was to hear the talk and they asked several great questions afterwards.</p>

<p>That visit was a success for me at various aspects of my career development. Which is discussed at various parts of the portfolio.</p>

      <h4> 07. NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION WITH THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY</h4>

      <div class="entrydescription">
        
        <p>Collaborations are an important part of any scientific project. Collaborations among group members are the minimum type of collaboration every scientist can do. However, wider collaborations with other groups locally, nationally, or internationally are important to increase and promote innovation and creativity in one’s research.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the LU environment is quite diverse and international of sorts, thus it is already rich in diversity offering great opportunities for exchange in ideas and expertise. During my PhD I have managed to maintain a few collaborations locally at Lund.</p>

<p>Moreover, the wider research community in the rest of Sweden and other countries offer various opportunities for collaborations.</p>

<p>This section shows my approach with collaboration during the PhD:</p>

              Knowledge in Collaboration Course: Reflection on Collaboration and Entrepreneurship

              <p><strong>Title: Relevance for me, my attitudes and what I want to learn.</strong>
Several factors may contribute to a successful research career and these factors are dependent on the environment where the research is conducted and the attitudes of the research. I do believe that collaboration and innovation are among these factors that contribute to a successful research career. However, I had not given enough consideration and thought to the role of entrepreneurship. Many biomedical researchers go into their perspective fields in the goal of figuring out a disease or a problem that affect humanity one way or another. Thus, entrepreneurship is not on the radar of many biomedical researcher. Personally, I think if an opportunity presents itself through my research career, I would pursue the entrepreneurship route. However, I do not have it as a direct goal of my career.</p>

<p>I believe that collaboration in research is extremely important. The more we learn in our fields, the more questions we have. And there isn’t enough time for anyone to explore a research question on their own. In terms of doctoral studies, I need collaborations to learn several of the skills that I need to finish my project. Currently, I have several collaborators locally at Lund university, and generally in Sweden in addition to other international collaborations. I believe that my role in these collaborations is to trust the expertise of my collaborators and give back the same level of quality to earn their trust. Having clear assigned roles in collaboration is usually very helpful to accomplish the different goals.</p>

<p>My current research is studying pathomechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal disease with unknown causes and no available cure. The lack of effective therapies can be attributed to the gap in knowledge of disease pathomechanisms. My research project is aimed at finding new transcriptional complexes that are active during disease. Knowledge gained in my research project can aid in finding new therapies for this lethal disease.</p>

<p>From the introductory lecture, there was a great focus on entrepreneurship. I would like to learn more about such opportunities and how our environment here (Lund) can be helpful in that regard. Additionally, I look forward to learning how to understand and create value of my research.</p>

              <p>I have been selected to represent the WCMM center at strategic meeting the KAW foundation and Wallenberg family representatives.</p>

<p>The goal of this meeting was for the KAW foundation to receive updates from Lund as one of its more recent centers in order to decide the path forward and strategize their focus areas for future funding.</p>

<p>THIS FELT LIKE A BIG DEAL. I honestly can say that this was one of the few times during my career in Sweden where I have witnessed a new level of professionalism. It is somewhat strange, but it was good exposure for me. I like being involved in strategic meetings as I think that I can voice a lot of the opinions of my peers.</p>

<p>I think I did great during this meeting and was able to participate in the conversations in a positive manner.</p>

              <p>Dr. Claudio Cantù is an expert in ChIP sequencing and CUT&amp;RUN technologies. This collaboration with Dr. Cantù has resulted in him becoming a co-supervisor on my PhD. This collaboration continues to be very important for my PhD project.</p>

<p>This collaboration ended up being one of the most important ones for my project. We have managed to successfully implement the CUT&amp;RUN technology for Yap/Taz in lung epithelial cells. This is normally very difficult to do for transcription factors, and even more difficult for co-factors like in our case. We managed to reproduce this across various samples of isolated primary alveolar type II cells.</p>

              <p>My main supervisor, Darcy Wagner, has trained me to do peer-review of scientific articles through doing. Every time she has gotten a new paper to review that is related to my work, she would inform the editor of that journal and let me help her with that review. 
We would work on the peer review together by first analysis the paper separately, second intensely discuss all aspects of the peer, and third write the main major, minor comments.</p>

<p>This process has helped improve the way I think about experiment design and about how I write my own scientific work.</p>

<p>Darcy always informs the editors of the trainees help so that the editors can recognize the expertise and maybe one day directly as a peer review.</p>

              <p>I have recently developed a protocol to immunolabel a whole mouse lung and process it so it can be imaged using light-sheet microscopy to visualize specific molecular features within full murine lungs. We call the method:  inFLATION: <strong>in</strong>fusion of <strong>F</strong>luorescent <strong>L</strong>abelled <strong>A</strong>ntibodies in <strong>T</strong>issue of <strong>I</strong>ntact <strong>O</strong>rga<strong>N</strong>s</p>

<p>This technique have showed great success in wildtype lungs. I have presented this data at the EMIM conference in Greece as mentioned section 6. One of the main questions I have received about this technique was whether this protocol is able to image diseased lung where normal lung architecture is damaged.</p>

<p>To address this question, we have collaborated with Dr. Irma Mahmutovic Persson, who is an expert on MRI and micro CT scans of rodent lungs for detection of lung fibrosis. In this collaboration, we have imaged the lungs using MRI micro CT and followed that by processing with our protocol to compare the imaging modules and to evaluate whether our protocol is capable of properly staining the diseased lung tissue.</p>

              <p>This collaboration has developed over time to include several aspects. We do qPCR and immunoblotting in our lab and that’s why Roberta, another PhD Student, and her PI Iben approached us for this collaboration.</p>

<p>This collaboration started by providing my help to Roberta and her student Linda on qPCR of the gene Aquaporin 4 (Aqp4). I have trained both of them and helped Linda throughout the whole process of Data acquisition.</p>

<p>The first version of the manuscript was not accepted. Thus, we decided to focus the manuscript on distinguishing between the different isotypes/variants of Aqp4. Thus, this collaboration grew further for us to design and validate new primers in addition to optimization of protein extraction from brain tissue and the immunoblotting of Aqp4.</p>

<p>If you ask me before going through this, how long it would take? I would have said it is very quick and painless. But the opposite has proved to be the case. Dealing with Aqp4 was very tricky and this collaboration took very long.</p>

<p>Luckily, we were able to pull it off and optimize all the technical aspects for this study and the manuscript is now submitted again to a different journal.</p>

              <p><strong>Unravelling the unknown of lung fibrosis to find a treatment for the incurable disease.</strong></p>

<p>Lung fibrosis is a deadly disease with no available cure. Lung fibrosis can be described as an excessive injury to the lung that stiffens it preventing the barer of the disease from breathing. If you think of the lung as a balloon, lung fibrosis is like crumbling parts of the balloon continuously without stopping. Currently, the only available drugs do not help the patients, they only slow down the disease progression. These patients only survive for a few years once diagnosed. This is because we do not understand the exact causes of the disease. My doctoral studies are focused on identifying specific mechanisms related to lung stiffness in order to find new effective therapies for lung fibrosis.</p>

<p>Although the exact causes of lung fibrosis are unknown, many molecular events have been studied and our understanding of the disease is increasing. The lung contains as many as 40 different cell types to carry out the various functions of the lung, some of which are known as epithelial cells. Epithelial cells are located on the surface of the internal parts of the lung and they are responsible for gas exchange (i.e. breathing). These cells are heavily damaged in patients with lung fibrosis.  Our research team has found two molecules to be involved in the damage of the epithelial cells, they are called YAP and TAZ, and they are known for their ability to sense changes in stiffness. In lung fibrosis, these molecules are active and are responsible for causing some of the disease characteristics. However, in normal conditions these molecules are necessary for maintaining normal functions. We are using state-of-the-arts techniques to identify the exact roles of these molecules in the different types of cells in health and disease. YAP and TAZ are like good cops that have gone rogue in fibrosis and we are investigating why so we can fix the damage they caused.</p>

<p>The problem with current approved drugs is that they are not specific and that is one of the reasons they do not work. Finding out the exact roles of YAP and TAZ in the lung compartments and learn how they are involved in the progression of lung fibrosis will lead us to finding highly specific drugs. Highly specific drugs will be able to stop the rogue cops without harming the good ones. Additionally, these molecules are involved in several other organs and diseases, thus knowledge gained in this research can be easily transferable to other disciplines.</p>

              <p>The NMT days were a great experience at many levels.</p>

<p>We are given the opportunity to present our science to high school students in terms they can understand.</p>

<p>At the WCMM research school, we decided to participate as a group and prepare the whole presentation together and since I was one of the trainee-representatives, I had to drive this project and collate everything from everyone.</p>

<p>It was an interesting experience so see people from several disciplines work on one topic and produce a popular version of the presentation.</p>

<p>I presented the English version of this outreach. It was a great experience to see how the high school students are excited to learn about this topic (3D (bio)-printing in medicine)</p>

              <p>I have written the title for this entry long time ago but I did not write any text at the time. It felt as if it was impossible to explain the feelings and the emotions that were going on at the time. I needed time to process it.</p>

<p>We work in the lung field and as much as we explain about what we research, it remains a puzzle for family and friends. So when something happens in relation to the lung, they turn to us to ask questions as if I had the medical knowledge to give them advice. The main challenge for me is that what people seek is advice rather than explanation.</p>

<p>So when the pandemic hit, It felt impossible to answer questions about the pandemic. Of course I was reading a lot of the papers that were coming out and listening to all the news, but at the same time, it’s not enough input to produce actionable advice for anybody to help them out. I later understood that what they want is reassurance that they will be fine. Simply, because they are scared.</p>

<p>I found the best way to deal with this was to actually stick to what I know and what I can understand and analyze. In other words, it was as if I was trying to do a popular summary of the papers that come out. Thus, whenever I got the chance, I put in the time to explain what I have learned in simple words for people around me. I think for some of the people around me they found it helpful and they were able to understand more of what’s going on in order to form their own decision of what to do.</p>

<p>I think understanding the depth of the problem, leads to more compliance with regulations and recommendations with regards to social distancing and other measures to prevent spread of the disease.</p>

<p>I honestly think that there is a lot left to process about the pandemic and it will be some time before we all fully recover.</p>

      <h4> 09. ETHICAL ISSUES</h4>

      <div class="entrydescription">
        
        <p>Since we deal with patient material and animals in our projects, several ethical issues have to be considered to avoid any harm to anyone. While different projects have different levels of ethical discussion, I do believe that all projects without exception must have some ethical issues to discuss.</p>

<p>We continuously discuss ethical issues in my group and address all issues at they appear.</p>

              <p>My research explores the role of specific co-transcriptional activators (Yap/Taz) in the lung epithelium in the context of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). IPF is a lethal chronic lung disease with no cure. The exact causes of the disease are unknown and median survival is 2.5 to 3.5 years. Current available therapies are only able to slow down the disease progression. To date, there isn’t a therapy that can stop or reverse this disease. The molecular mechanisms of disease progression involve several signaling pathways in the different cell types of the lung. The specific role of the lung epithelium is not well understood. The aim of my research project is to identify new transcriptional complexes that are relevant to IPF pathogenesis.</p>

<p>The approaches of my research studies are highly reliant on the use of primary cells. We thus isolate primary epithelial cells from both mouse and human tissue. Of course, there are ethical considerations for the use of animal or human subjects.</p>

<p>In the mouse experiments, the aim to induce fibrotic characteristics using the administration of Bleomycin. This model of fibrosis is well established and commonly used. We have obtained the ethical approvals for appropriate durations of the length of the experiments. There are not many ethical issues with the cell isolation after the animal has been sacrificed. However, the use of the specific cells in our studies will help answer our research question directly. Thus, this contributes to the concept of the 3R as we will not need to sacrifice many mice for the purpose of the study. A big part of my work is to optimize these isolation protocols to cut down the number of animals used to less than half of what is equivalently used in literature.</p>

<p>As for the use of human tissue, we have a partnership with the thoracic surgery department at the hospital. We have been granted the ethical approval to use excess tissue from transplant surgeries and possibly failed transplants. These tissues would be disposed of otherwise. Thus, we have obtained the ethical approval to use these tissues and all the necessary considerations are taken into place, such as informed consent. The way it is done in Sweden is that the person receiving a donated organ is the responsible person for what happens to that tissue. We thus get informed consent to use this tissue from the recipient of the donor lungs. Of course, all these procedures are taken care of at the hospital. At our preclinical lab, we only get the tissue if it has been approved to be sent to us. I mostly do epithelial cell isolations from these tissues. Thus, one ethical consideration that is always taken in consideration is the privacy and the dealing with sensitive information. It is of course highly unlikely to identify someone solely by the tissue, but we anyways have taken a lot of measures to avoid any breech of this privacy. When we receive a human tissue material, we assign a new identifier for that piece of tissue and all data regarding the patients/donors are not provided for us. The only information we obtain are the age and gender of the of tissue as approved. The reason we need this information is because they play a major role in the behavior of the cells obtained from these tissues (i.e. cells from older tissues do not have the same proliferative capacity).</p>

<p>We are highly privileged to be able to perform studies on primary tissues. We are always grateful for that and we do treat these tissues with the most respect.</p>

              <p>Andréa Wiszmeg from the Department of Social Work at Malmö University has reached out to conduct an interview with me with regards to a project on ethics they are running.</p>

<p>Among the aims of this project was to undertand how “responsible researchers”  are fostered. Here is a quote from the abstrac for their project:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the aims of the project is to understand how “responsible researchers” are fostered. We look into how ethical reflexivity is expressed, practiced and understood in the day-to-day of biomedical research environments. But what happens to our knowledge production when we make biomedical researchers engage in this bird’s-eye view on their research and its socio-cultural circumstances? How can neither taking a distanced position, nor engaging in direct activism but rather pushing toward areas we consider possible hotbeds for public debate be further theoretically conceptualized? What does such an endeavor imply for our role as STS scholars? And how does that connect to the tendency to engage humanities and social science scholars as interpreters and mediators in cross-disciplinary projects in knowledge-intensive policy fields, such as ours ? In what way is the symmetry principle (Bloor, 1976) affected, when value-laden initiatives as ethical reflexivity and public engagement is treated as an inherent good or as “truths” to be pursued?<br />

</blockquote>

<p>In this interview, we have talked about the use of 3D bioprinting in research and what are the ethical considerations that we take in order to maintain our reponsible research behaviour. We have also talked about the use of primary cells in research and the ethical aspects of that.</p>

              Reflection on the ethics of Big Data and the types of data that need to be secured
            </a>

              <p>There is no doubt that the big data has changed the way we do science and have opened so many new avenues that allow us to explore our data better. There are many techniques right now that utilize big data or produce big data such genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and many other omics. However, there is an important issue that is associated with this. Which is when you produce big data from a patient sample, it is as if you are creating a fingerprint or signature of that person’s molecular makeup. But the level of information you can obtain from each element is variable of course. And it is not always clear whether you get identifying information from that comic or not. So maybe one day. You imagine that your big data does not have any identifying information about your patients, however. Somebody can at some point produce a technique, or a methodology that will obtain such data from your data set, since our bioinformatics pipelines are increasingly improving and there’s a lot more information that we can learn from data by simply doing some mathematical models on it. Therefore, the question becomes, how do we deal with this when we are dealing with patient samples? Of course, the ethical committees that approve studies that contain big data have thought about this and it is becoming a requirement for people. To include how they will save and secure the patient data.
This is certainly an interesting topic. While patient information must be secured at any cost, there should always be enough access to the data used in any analysis. To be able to fully evaluate the science that is produced.
I think that a lot of the main institutes are trying hard to address this issue and there are many regulations that are associated with it. And there are many big institutes that provide Tools such as NCBI or ENI. However. These tools are not usually available for all types of data. An example, there are several recent advances in imaging that allow us to produce high content high quality images of samples that may one day be able to contain identifying information that can identify the patient of that sample. Such as this specific marker. Or things that are associated with disease.
In my own research, I usually do my best to deidentify all the samples that I have. And make sure that there is no information that can be used to identify the samples that we are using. I think the field is moving in a good direction and that there is a lot of effort going into preventing problems in this regard. However, I think it is important for all of us who are working with this type of data to be careful with this and to be considerate of the patient material that we get.</p>

              <p>In reading My Portfolio so far, it is probably noticeable that I talk a lot about big data and the type of things we need to analyze it and store it. A very important resource that has been available during the PhD was the LUNARC cluster. High-powered computation is very important for this type of analysis because you require a lot of RAM and a lot of CPU in order to be handle such large datasets. However. Do you have computing systems need to be maintained? And there are of course many ways to do that, one of which is to be able to update these systems online. So, in many cases, the high computing cluster is connected to the Internet, so the software packages can be updating themselves automatically or manually. So, when having any system connected to the Internet. This system becomes susceptible to attack. And that it’s possible that any type of data can be stolen from that system. Our high computing cluster is quite secure and requires multifactor authentication to be accessed. However. It is still important to be able to secure data and especially patient data.
Luckily. We have the LUBI cluster. LUBI Is another computer cluster That is managed by the stem cell center and is used for secure data. This system is disconnected from the Internet and can only be accessed while you are present at the BMC. I think it’s great that we have access to the system Even though it requires a lot of more work in order to be able to analyze data on it. The reason is that you require a lot of software to be installed manually on another machine and then transfer it to install it on the secure cluster. Of course, it is worth it to do all of this to be protective of patient data.</p>

<p>Currently, there isn’t a similar system to use for analyzing imaging data. Therefore, it’s important to try to fight for resources to be able to create such a system.</p>

      <h4> 10. CAREER DEVELOPMENT</h4>

      <div class="entrydescription">
        
        <p>There are several career paths that can be taken after the PhD. When I started my PhD, I thought that the academic track is the one that I will take moving forward. However, throughout the PhD, I have changed my perspective a lot and learned a lot more about other career tracks that can suit me.</p>

              <p>Maximillian Ottosson is the CEO of Cellevate. He started this company in 2014 and now in 2021 the company has collaborators and customers around the globe.</p>

<p>I sat down with Max to ask him questions about the struggles and challenges that he faced during his endeavor. At this stage in my PhD, I am contemplating which direction I want to take after my PhD and whether I should be planning this early on.</p>

<p>The conversation was very inspiring and had a lot eye openers. While, I have not decided yet which route to take after the PhD, I can certainly say I have learned a lot from this conversation.</p>

              <p>During the keystone conference I joined a career development sessions and talked to several well-established scientists. I found this session very interesting and made me reflect on my career.</p>

<p>This workshop will included <strong>6 influential scientific leaders</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Juanita Merchant, University of Arizona College of Medicine</li>
  <li>Valentina Greco, Yale School of Medicine</li>
  <li>Deborah Johnson, CEO, Keystone Symposia</li>
  <li>Arjun Rah, University of Pennsylvania</li>
  <li>Frederic de Sauvage, Genentech</li>
  <li>Thale Jarvis, CSO, Keystone Symposia</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The workshop aimed to expose students and post docs to the breadth of scientific opportunities that are available to them, encourage trainees to discuss career options with scientific leaders, and develop mentorship relationships outside of their own laboratories.</em></p>

              Getting rejected for a grant application
            </a>

            <div class="entrycontent" id="c10-3" style="display:none;">

              <div class="entrydate"></div>

              <p>I have applied for one of the fysiografen calls during 2020 in order to co-finance the Cytation 5 device. I asked for nearly 450 000 SEK. I gave it my best and I think I did ok. But unfortunately, I was not selected to receive any funding from this grant call.</p>

<p>Of course, there are many questions I have on why. This lead me to reflect on many things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Was this grant the right type of grant?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was I qualified to apply for such a grant?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the requested amount too high for this call?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should I try again with a different call?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There isn’t a one way to answer all of these questions. There are several ways to address these issues.</p>

<p>We found out that there was a priority for PhD students who have finished their half time on this grant call. So it is possible that this has contributed to the fact that I did not get the grant.</p>

<p>In any case, I think I learned a lot from writing this one, and I will not stop there. I will keep improving and keep applying.</p>

<p>This was a large grant (5 million SEK) and it is the first time I sit in such interview. It was a great experience for me.</p>

<p>It was such a great feeling to learn that the grant was awarded.</p>

<p>This experience has added to my career development as a scientist of how to conduct grant interviews.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> My group leader has received this grant.</p>

              <p>At the beginning of my PhD, I thought that I wanted to be doing an academic career. I think this has changed overtime due to many factors. I will discuss a few of these factors in this entry. However, this is an ongoing conversation I’m having with myself about my future.</p>

<p><strong>Type of work.</strong><br />
There has been a shift in my view of what type of experiments and work I would like to do on the scientific field. In the beginning, I was oriented towards experimental approaches. I have thoroughly enjoyed working in the wetlands for a very long time. However. I feel that during the PhD this has changed to me wanting to work more with bioinformatics and big data sets. I think previously I did not understand the power of bioinformatics and big data. I have learned a lot about this during my PhD. Since I had some background in programming, I decided that I wanted to do all my online from attics during the PhD. My supervisor has supported me by allowing me to go to courses to learn the skills that I need. Furthermore, I have spent a lot of time to develop new pipelines to be able to analyze datasets. I take a lot of pride in being able to do this. Because it’s usually very difficult to communicate with bioinformaticians to get the proper analysis that you need. It is best when you are familiar with the biology and the science and also the programming.</p>

<p><strong>The corona pandemic.</strong><br />
The pandemic has shown us what we are capable of doing when we are faced with challenges with our research. I think we have done a fairly good job at maintaining productivity while dealing with the pandemic. One aspect that I have learned about myself during this, is that I want to take a different approach in my research, and I want to move more towards bioinformatics. I enjoy making programs and tools to achieve analyses, then why not do it full time.</p>

<p><strong>Entrepreneurship.</strong> <br />
I am also contemplating whether I want to remain in the academic field. I think there is an opportunity for me to grow my skill further to work outside of academia and provide a service for data analysis instead. This would suite me very well as I like to always work on variety of projects simultaneously.</p>

      <h4> 11. SUPERVISION/SUPERVISOR</h4>

      <div class="entrydescription">
        
        <p>Supervision styles vary greatly between supervisors and supervisees. I think it is a challenge to find out what supervision style suites a person best, but also the style that you prefer as a supervisee.</p>

<p>I consider myself to be generally independant and I prefer to get my supervisor involved when I think I cannot figure out the task myself. Of course, the timing of this process is very important that time isn’t wasted in the meanwhile. I discuss this topic in details with my main PhD supervisor every year at our annual meeting. Usually we analyse the previous year and make decisions for moving forward.</p>

<p>This section contains a few of my reflections on supervision:</p>

              <p>I have been working in the research field since 2015 which is not a long time, but fairly long enough to learn about my learning abilities. I have realized that I am very particular about how I learn things, and more importantly how I like to be supervised. I consider myself very independent and I always like to try to solve issues on my own before pursing the answer from some one else.</p>

<p>I am lucky to have a unique relationship with my supervisor. We do discuss the supervision styles quite often, not only how she supervises me, but also how I can supervise others. It is a chain after all.</p>

<p>LBR lab, an example, consists of more than 15 members, each of which has a unique way of learning. It is important to always observe how people perceive information and absorb new content.</p>

              <p>I started the PhD program knowing that I will have to reflect on supervision as the project progresses.</p>

<p>We were quickly able to identify that we needed a supervisor with strong biochemistry expertise in order to address the transcription factor identification part of the project. 
My main supervisor, Darcy Wagner, has met Dr. Cantù in one of the WCMM retreats. I contacted him and scheduled a skype meeting. I described my project to Dr. Cantù and we immediately agreed that he can be very instrumental in my PhD studies.</p>

<p>A few months later, we planned a pilot study and that was a confirmation for both of us that he would not only be a collaborator, but also a supervisor.</p>

<p>I am glad to have found Dr. Cantù and I look forward to the rest of my PhD.</p>

              <p>I was fortunate to be in the LBR lab before starting the PhD. I was able to understand the capabilities and limitations of myself and my environment. My PhD project was designed by myself and my supervisor. We worked together on finding the best experiment designs to address all questions raised under the unified aim of the study.</p>

<p>The process of study design was done in tandem with writing a VR starting grant. Darcy wrote her starting grant on this project. We sat through several meetings and brain-storming to reach the final design of the project. I helped Darcy with the VR grant mainly in experiment design and figures. This experience was very useful for me to think at a higher level of project design and also to learn more skills in grant writing and creation.</p>

<p>I am thankful to have had that opportunity to take a project from its very beginnings and I hope to see it through to a good place by the end of my PhD.</p>

<p><strong>The aftermath</strong> I felt very good during the presentation and managed to comfortably explain all the different aspects of my PhD studies. (<a href="/assets/files/halftime_papers.pdf"><strong>list of planned papers at the time</strong></a>). I was able to have a good conversation with my opponents that was focused on the bigger picture an the relevance of my project, rather than experimental details of the different experiments. To me, this indicates that the quality of the experiments was high.</p>

<p>I hope that I will be able to complete my PhD despite the spread of the corona virus. While Sweden is not shutting down completely like other countries, we are already seeing changes in the dynamics of the different facilities and labs at the university.</p>

              Reflection on supervision during and after the pandemic
            </a>

            <div class="entrycontent" id="c11-5" style="display:none;">

              <div class="entrydate"></div>

              <p><strong>The pandemic has affected us one way or another.</strong> While the university has not shut down completely during the pandemic, it was evident that there are several changes that affected everybody. For example, there were a lot of issues with ordering, a lot of delays with receiving shipments and materials to use. There was a lot of shortage in materials needed for protection, such as gloves. Moreover, it was not clear. Where there will be extensions for PhD students due to the pandemic or not. That definitely has affected the progress of the PhD. That also has affected the way the supervisor has to deal with this. I think it is a two way problem. The supervisor has to implement a new method of supervision and the supervisor has to also communicate differently about what they’re going through. I think overall. We managed very well to deal with the pandemic in my lab. Here are some examples of the adjustments:<br />
<strong>Less IRL meetings.</strong><br />
The availability of systems that allow online meetings has been a great addition to our routines. it is important to know that there is a way to communicate even though you cannot meet in person. of course, it took us a while to be able to adjust to this method of communication however I think after a while it was very useful and I think even after the pandemic we are still using any online systems on daily basis that fill the gap in communication. But this of course meant that you have to actively think about scheduling meetings with your supervisor in order to be have access to them. While it is a great behavior to schedule meetings before hand, it is sometimes difficult to Evaluate whether you need that help early in advance.</p>

<p><strong>Less experiments vs. different types of experiments.</strong><br />
The delays in receiving materials and closures caused by the pandemic have forced us to change our daily routines and focus on tasks that require computer work more than experiments. But this does not mean that we are not able to do experiments. On the contrary I think this gave us an opportunity to evaluate how much experimentation we need versus how much time we need to think about the experiments we do and the time we need to analyze it. An example, there are sometimes experiments that you shelf to look at later and it takes a long time before you can analyze them. I think the pandemic has helped us to analyze a lot of these experiments, and at the same time has taught us to be able to evaluate whether we need an experiment.
I was lucky personally because I just had generated an RNA seq data set. which meant that I could spend a good amount of time analyzing it. this was a great experience for me, and it has deepened my love for bioinformatics and I think I will implement more of the bioinformatics in my future career.</p>

<p><strong>Supervising students during the pandemic.</strong> I’ve had several students during the pandemic some of which we’re able to perform experiments in the lab and others were able to do their products online without having to come to the lab. while there were some struggles, I think we managed to produce great work from these students. you can see some of the reports in the teaching section of this portfolio. I can say that I enjoy supervising students while they are here in person, however being able to teach them while they are online gives me more time to focus on my own study and also gives them their time to be able to develop on their own. I think it was great for them to experience that and I think they will benefit from it in their future.</p>

<p><strong>Effect on career goals.</strong><br />
As I have mentioned earlier, I focused more on bioinformatics during the pandemic. I found it to be very interesting and very exciting for me and I may decide to transition into bioinformatics fully after the end to PhD.</p>

      <h4> 12. ADMINISTRATION, ORGANISATION AND LEADERSHIP</h4>

      <div class="entrydescription">
        
        <p>During the PhD studies, I have been involved in several administrative/leadership activities. I think it is important to train in that manner as the amount of these activities increase as you move forward in your career. 
My approach during the whole PhD has been: Be involved in at least one non-phd-project related activity at all times.</p>

<p>The following entries will cover some of the various administrative, organizational, and leadership roles:</p>

              <p>I like drawing, sketching, and graphic design. I do it when I can as a hobby in my free time. 
But when I heard we needed a logo for our lab. I decided to give it a shot and design one.</p>

<p>This is the result after getting feedback from everyone. I am glad that it is being used as the LBR logo for everything we do.</p>

<p>I also enjoy web design, so I managed to build the <a href="https://lbr-lab.com/">lbr website</a>.</p>

              <p><strong>WCMM research school first retreat 2018 - 2019</strong></p>

<p>The VCM research school has come to an end. it has been a good year full of events, lectures, and collaborations. now it’s time to close this chapter in a good way. as a student representative one of my duties was to organize the retreat for the research school.<br />
This was a challenging task because this was the first of its type. There are no kind of expectation for this event, and we want it to be a good event, full of good science and good fun for everybody. I think we managed to pull it off very well. We have managed to bring speakers from abroad that gave amazing talks, such as Dr Vasilis Ntziachristos’s talk on photoacoustic live imaging.<br />
The challenge of this experience has improved my leadership skills. Everyone who came to the retreat liked it a lot and enjoyed it very much. So that was very rewarding. I think if I have to do this again, I would do a much better job.</p>

              <p>I have been very fortunate to work with such a nice group of people. During this organization, among many things, I took care of organizing activities for the attendees and started a new trend of using an app instead of a booklet for the retreat program. Most people liked the idea and enjoyed using the app.</p>

<p>I have gone through the process of procurement of this awesome device and so happy it is finally here. The company reps: Helene Stanberg and Fabian Kuck have been super helpful in this process.</p>

<p>Let the greatness begin !!!</p>

<p>Update: 2022-02-15</p>

<p>I have been taking care of the device for a while now and I have generated a workflow to deal with new incoming persons who need training on the device. Here is an example for the form I give people before I introduce to the device to understand their needs:</p>

              Joining MDR and becoming the PhD students representative at the LFN

              <p>At the last year of my PhD, I decided to join the doctoral student council (MDR) to represent the PhD students in one of the faculty boards.</p>

<p>I nominated myself for the academic appointment board - Lärarförslagsnämnd (LFN) and MDR selected me for that role. I selected this board, because I needed to learn more about the process the university does to hire new academic roles.</p>

<p>One requirement for this role was that the representative has to speak Swedish. My Swedish language skills have definitely improved throughout the last four years, but I did not think it was good enough to take part in official meetings. I think I understand Swedish very well, however, it remains difficult for me to articulate what I would like to say in Swedish. Thus, I have talked to the chairs of the board and they agreed to let me speak English when I need to give a comment on a specific topic. However, the meetings were to be held in Swedish.</p>

<p>I found this experience fulfilling and I think I have learned a lot from being on the LFN board. I think it may even contributed to improving my Swedish.</p>
